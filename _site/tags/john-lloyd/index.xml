      <description>https://capx.co/scottish-independence-is-one-of-the-great-confidence-tricks-of-our-time/&#xA;John Lloyd, writing in CapX, says:&#xA;The paradox of Scottish nationalism is that it commands strong, even at times majority support – and yet the foundations for the movement are so weak&amp;hellip;After more than three centuries, the Scots nation has become an integral part of the British state, so deeply integrated that its post-independence unravelling from the UK would make the Brexit separation look straightforward. A certain loss would be the £10-12bn a year subsidy which Scotland receives from the Treasury under the long lamented (by the relatively-deprived English regions) but apparently unreformable Barnett formula.</description>
