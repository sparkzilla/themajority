      <description>Two anti-Majority articles in The National today ( Expert’ Unionist vanishes after evidence query and Hundreds of active members of pro-Union group found to be fake ) serve no purpose other than to try to bully and intimidate us and our writers. They are not based on any news, but serve simply to say, ‘If you write articles against Scottish Nationalism, you will be targeted’.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;Contrary to their claims, I have not received a single email or telephone call from the National asking for comment.</description>
