      <description>The UK Government should stop gambling with its territorial, economic, cultural and social integrity.&#xA;A couple of weeks ago, Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said that Scots could have a second ‘independence’ referendum if polls showed a consistent majority of 60% of Scots in favour of it.

      <description>In a recent speech to the Irish Dáil (parliament), Heather Humphreys, TD of the Fine Gael party, reproached Sinn Fein, saying that with Sinn Fein &#34;it is always a case of do as we say and not do as we do&#34;. The masterful speech echoes in the current debate on nationalism within Scotland, for with the SNP it is also always a case of &#34;do as we say and not as we do&#34;</description>
