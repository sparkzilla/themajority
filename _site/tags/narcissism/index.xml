      <description>The SNP is certainly not a party in the conventional sense.&#xA;It is a post-national movement that defines itself by creating enemies and enmities. It tears through Scottish society, because it sees Scotland very differently from the rest of us. It is an ugly, frightening imagination of our country that is created through collective narcissism.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;Narcissism is the inability to distinguish self from an internalised ideal. It is pathological, unhealthy and dangerous.</description>
