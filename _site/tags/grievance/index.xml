      <description>https://mercinon.wordpress.com/2020/06/12/the-biscuit-factory-line-of-history-and-scottish-nationalism/&#xA;Roger White says:&#xA;The daily pettiness of Scottish nationalism certainly assails anyone who looks for it on social media. This blog is scattered with examples over the last few years – a bar of Mackies Scottish chocolate has the temerity to include an image of the union flag; people who ask awkward questions of SNP politicians on TV are hounded online; Nicola Sturgeon meets Theresa May and manages to omit the union flag from the official photo; an SNP MP complains that the BBC weather map ‘make Scotland literally appear less significant’; the bookshop at Edinburgh airport doesn’t display Scottish books (it does, the complainant concerned was in the wrong shop); and so on and so on.</description>
