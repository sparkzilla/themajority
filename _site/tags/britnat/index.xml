      <description>To my fellow anti-Nationalists: With the deepest of respect, you&#39;re doing it wrong.&#xA;Every day, I see people arguing on Twitter, trying to counter Nationalist arguments. One thread I&#39;ve been following on Twitter has literally hundreds of responses trying to convince Nationalists that they are wrong about Scotland’s finances. Of course the Nationalists are wrong.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;But has all that discussion done any good? No. Has anyone been converted? No. Has it taken the fight back to them?</description>
