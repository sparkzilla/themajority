      <description>With polls indicating a win for the SNP in the Scottish elections in 2021, and widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservative leadership, Andrew Waddell outlines six things he believes the Scottish Conservatives can do to get back on track.&#xA;#6 Get back to opposing Nationalists&#xD;Instead of criticising Jacob Rees Mogg, or praising Sturgeon’s handling of the crisis, Scottish Conservatives should be hammering home Nationalist failures. It&#39;s not like there are few to choose from: from the Nike Cover Up, to the failure to deliver councils their additional funding from Westminster, anti-English racists on the border, the third-worst COVID&amp;nbsp; death rate in the world, and an appalling number of deaths in care homes.</description>

      <description>To my fellow anti-Nationalists: With the deepest of respect, you&#39;re doing it wrong.&#xA;Every day, I see people arguing on Twitter, trying to counter Nationalist arguments. One thread I&#39;ve been following on Twitter has literally hundreds of responses trying to convince Nationalists that they are wrong about Scotland’s finances. Of course the Nationalists are wrong.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;But has all that discussion done any good? No. Has anyone been converted? No. Has it taken the fight back to them?</description>
