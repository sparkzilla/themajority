      <description>In modern-day Scotland, we see:&#xA;A country unnecessarily divided as Nationalist leaders promote division to boost their own power&amp;nbsp;Our friends and neighbours entranced by ugly Nationalism and influenced daily by dishonest propaganda churned out by the Nationalist establishmentPoliticians who always put their immature dreams above the welfare of the peopleA looming one-party state where unsuitable and incompetent people are promoted based on party loyaltyAn ineffective and divided oppositionLeaders who casually dismiss the vote of the majority And we see the silent majority of Scots cowed into silence and ignored by the government and the media.</description>
