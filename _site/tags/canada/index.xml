      <description>Nationalists, the world over, love to think of themselves and their causes as unique, special and a product of their own &#34;glorious&#34; history. Still, as always, reality is far from their fevered imaginations.&#xA;For example, Separatist claims that &#34;independence is normal&#34; are easily dismissed by pointing out that many of the countries they claim to admire are, in fact, political unions, often far more recent than the UK.&#xA;As time goes on, and their desperate cries for secession are revealed as a gargantuan political squirrel, I am reminded more and more of other Separatist movements that have done exactly what the SNP have done and got just about as far as the SNP will.</description>
