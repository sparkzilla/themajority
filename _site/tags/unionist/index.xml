      <description>To my fellow anti-Nationalists: With the deepest of respect, you&#39;re doing it wrong.&#xA;Every day, I see people arguing on Twitter, trying to counter Nationalist arguments. One thread I&#39;ve been following on Twitter has literally hundreds of responses trying to convince Nationalists that they are wrong about Scotland’s finances. Of course the Nationalists are wrong.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;But has all that discussion done any good? No. Has anyone been converted? No. Has it taken the fight back to them?</description>

      <description>One of the main techniques extremist groups like Nationalists use to make themselves appear normal is to label their opponents something they would like them to be and then attack that label.&#xA;By labelling their opponents as “Unionists” or “Yoons” they associate them with Union Jacks, British bulldogs, Churchill, and The Queen.&#xA;(Of course the Union that the Nationalists almost always imagine is English — they never include Northern Ireland or Wales, or the Scottish people who are part of Britain.</description>
