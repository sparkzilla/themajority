Democracy, devolution and subsidiarity should be the driving principles with powerful regional and national governments able to build strong, vibrant, regional and national sustainable communities within a democratised political system where each level of government has clear established and legally binding rights and responsibilities that cannot be taken away at anybody’s whim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
