      <description>The camera shakes. A young child comes into view, the first of many, their gleaming eyes open and eager. They start talking in the coached manner of totalitarian regimes: The children of North Korea would like to say ‘thank you’ to our Dear Leader.

Thank you for caring for every individual life and for always thinking about the children.</description>
