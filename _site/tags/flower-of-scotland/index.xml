Robert Kerr was washing his car while singing the country’s national anthem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pensioner from Biggar, Lanarkshire, says this is the latest incident in an ongoing feud with English neighbour Steven Calveley. The 68-year-old moved in next door to Robert and his wife Margaret four years ago - with problems going on ever since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
