      <description>This article was written on September 11, 2014, a few days before the Scottish Independence Referendum. It is just one of many possible pasts or futures. Let me know what you think would have happened in the comments.&#xA;On September 18, 2014, Scotland votes &#39;yes&#39; to independence by 51%. Independence supporters claimed they wanted a more democratic system, but now 49% of the country is living under a system they don&#39;t want.</description>
