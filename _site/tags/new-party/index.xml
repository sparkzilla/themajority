      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article was submitted by Damien Scott of Scottish Opposition Forum.&lt;/strong&gt; If you would like to write for The Majority, please contact &lt;a rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; href=&#34;mailto:mark@themajority.scot&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mark@themajority.scot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party under Ruth Davidson’s leadership in terms of Scotland-only contested seats reached their high watermark in May 2016. The party won 32 seats in the Scottish Parliament election, up an impressive 19 seats on 2011, pushing Scottish Labour into a humiliating third place and denying the SNP an overall majority. Davidson’s charges followed this up with their best General Election result in three decades in the 2017 General Election, those 13 MPs keeping Theresa May clinging to power in Downing Street.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
