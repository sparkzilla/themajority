      <description>So the SNP is&amp;nbsp;intending&amp;nbsp;to “extend the right to stand for election to sixteen year olds.” Who knew? I had assumed that&amp;nbsp;they&amp;nbsp;already&amp;nbsp;were&amp;nbsp;but maybe Ross Greer, the wokier-than-thou Scottish Green MSP only&amp;nbsp;identifies&amp;nbsp;as sixteen. It is, I am forced to admit, a brilliant strategy. At a stroke ‘gammons’ and ‘boomers’ like me will be focused on this latest provocation rather than asking how the Scottish ‘government’ could possibly have&amp;nbsp;committed around £240,000,000 &amp;nbsp;in the shipyards and still have no ferries; or where the allegedly missing £660,000 from the SNP’s ‘indy fund’ is; or how it is that Nicola Sturgeon’s publisher allegedly received over £295,000 of public money prior to the publication of her ‘inspirational’ selected speeches&amp;nbsp;Women Hold up Half the Sky&amp;nbsp;(a title borrowed from Chairman Mao); or what has happened to the&amp;nbsp;£5bn&amp;nbsp;Covid support money destined for Scottish businesses&amp;nbsp;that Audit Scotland think is unaccounted for?</description>
