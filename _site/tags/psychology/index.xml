      <description>The SNP is certainly not a party in the conventional sense.&#xA;It is a post-national movement that defines itself by creating enemies and enmities. It tears through Scottish society, because it sees Scotland very differently from the rest of us. It is an ugly, frightening imagination of our country that is created through collective narcissism.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;Narcissism is the inability to distinguish self from an internalised ideal. It is pathological, unhealthy and dangerous.</description>

      <description>To my fellow anti-Nationalists: With the deepest of respect, you&#39;re doing it wrong.&#xA;Every day, I see people arguing on Twitter, trying to counter Nationalist arguments. One thread I&#39;ve been following on Twitter has literally hundreds of responses trying to convince Nationalists that they are wrong about Scotland’s finances. Of course the Nationalists are wrong.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;But has all that discussion done any good? No. Has anyone been converted? No. Has it taken the fight back to them?</description>
