<p>NICOLA Sturgeon received no written briefings from her chief advisers on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/coronavirus/">coronavirus</a> during the first months of the global pandemic, the Scottish Government has admitted.</p>
<p>Despite chairing Scottish emergency committee meetings on Covid, the First Minister received only verbal updates from her chief medical officer and national clinical director.</p>
<p>The Government said the advisers also shared no written briefings with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/health/">Health</a> Secretary Jeane Freeman at the time.</p></div>

<p>A care home boss fears staff unwittingly gave coronavirus to elderly residents as more evidence emerges that Scottish ministers ignored international warnings of an “iceberg” of asymptomatic cases ahead.</p>
<p>Tony Banks, founder of the Balhousie Care Group which operates 26 care homes across Scotland with about 940 residents, accused the Scottish ministers of a “disgusting” attempt to deflect attention from their own “missed opportunities” by singling out private care homes for intense public scrutiny over hospitals and community deaths.</p></div>

The obvious thing to say to all of that is that there’s no such thing – there is no Scottish identity or value system – but perhaps nationalists love lockdown because it bolsters the illusion that there is. Suddenly, all Scottish people are broadly behaving in the same way for the same reasons. Suddenly, there really is an “us”. And what goes with an “us”? A “them” of course.</p></div>

<p>An outsider would conclude that, while Johnson’s government has handled this crisis poorly, Sturgeon’s has been a paragon of success. Yet the facts are entirely at odds with that. The Scottish Government has fallen down on the job at least as often, and as badly, as its UK counterpart. The First Minister is no longer encouraging us to compare her performance with that in England and Wales.</p></div>

<p>Nicola Sturgeon is facing a rebellion from parts of rural Scotland over her cautious plan for easing lockdown, over fears that it will lead to children receiving a “second-class” education.</p>
<p>Council leaders on Scottish islands said it made little sense to force them to reopen their schools at the same pace as those in cities, as they have seen just one new case of coronavirus in more than a month and poor internet provision made home learning impossible.</p></div>
