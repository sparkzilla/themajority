      <description>Imagine two salespeople at your door. One sells apples, the other oranges. Both fruits cost the same.&#xA;The apple salesperson says, ‘Buy this apple, it’s tasty!’. The orange salesperson, worried at this simple message, tries a different approach, ‘You like apples? This orange is just like an apple’.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;Which one are you most likely to choose?&#xA;If the orange salesperson doesn’t believe in their product, why should we? There are many selling strategies, but dissing your own product never works.</description>
