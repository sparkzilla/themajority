      <description>With polls indicating a win for the SNP in the Scottish elections in 2021, and widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservative leadership, Andrew Waddell outlines six things he believes the Scottish Conservatives can do to get back on track.&#xA;#6 Get back to opposing Nationalists&#xD;Instead of criticising Jacob Rees Mogg, or praising Sturgeon’s handling of the crisis, Scottish Conservatives should be hammering home Nationalist failures. It&#39;s not like there are few to choose from: from the Nike Cover Up, to the failure to deliver councils their additional funding from Westminster, anti-English racists on the border, the third-worst COVID&amp;nbsp; death rate in the world, and an appalling number of deaths in care homes.</description>

      <description>When will the opposition parties in Scotland learn to fight? Today I was appalled to see yet another weak and compliant message from Jackson Carlaw, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, praising the Nationalists for their response to COVID-19.&amp;nbsp;&#xA;https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1278663688346570753&#xD;This comes on the heels of an earlier tweet where he did the same:&#xA;https://twitter.com/ScotTories/status/1247056001079095296&#xD;Confidence in the First Minister? W.T.A.F.&#xA;Jackson, a wee clue: they are not your friends. They are Nationalists who are destroying our country.</description>
