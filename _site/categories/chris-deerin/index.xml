Or, to put it another way: Scottish Labour has adopted what feels like its 3,432nd position on independence in the past decade. Nothing has revealed Labour’s struggle for relevance north of the border as much as its hokey-cokey on independence. It has gone from a firm “No” in 2014 to a half-hearted “we’d rather not, but maybe”, to “if people vote for it, we can’t deny them the choice”, then back to a firm “No”. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
