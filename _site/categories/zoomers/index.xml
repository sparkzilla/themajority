      <description>On our daily trawl through the nether regions of Scottish twitter we came across this thread by @AOUBAlba. As you may recall, All Under One Banner organise pro-Separation marches for 99.99% of the Scottish population who stay home.&#xA;I&#39;ve been in chats with quite a few of these marchers who claim their Nationalism is &#34;civic and joyous&#34;. Yet is that really true? Yesterday, AUOB asked the question, &#34;What&#39;s the first thing that should be changed once Scotland regains independence?</description>
