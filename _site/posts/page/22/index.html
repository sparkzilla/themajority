<p>Permanent Secretary Leslie Eaves tweeted a picture of herself kneeling outside her home in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>Using her official @PermSecScot account, she wrote: “I #TakeTheKnee in solidarity &amp; support of #BlackLivesMatter”.</p>
<p>The post came a day after Ms Sturgeon said she felt “total solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement&quot;.</p></div>

<p>So how have the London-based newsroom decision-makers covered Scotland in the current crisis? Overwhelmingly, they have done this by including extracts from the daily press briefings by Nicola Sturgeon, usually to exemplify difference between the Scottish approach and that of the UK government. In other words, each sound-bite reflects the chosen theme of Ms Sturgeon, without any critical response.</p></div>
