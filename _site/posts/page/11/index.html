That tower reminds me of the current SNP, as Nicola Sturgeon and her cronies pull the blocks out from under themselves.
In a recent contribution to the Spectator it was noted that, despite the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon's woeful handling of a myriad of domestic issues, she and her party remain popular amongst Scottish voters, seemingly defying electoral and political gravity.</div>

“Nothing escapes The Eye,” grins Dr Dave Bowman.
His lab at Heriot Watt has just unveiled the latest big data computer project that will revolutionise political campaigning. With cutting edge artificial intelligence, The Eye aims to win – and win big.
“Remember how Dominic Cummings scribbled for hours to come up with ‘Take Back Control’,” Bowman says. “Now, The Eye can pump out a killer slogan in 0.</div>

The Reverend I. M. Jolly is not his normal sunny self: “We’re doomed, I tell ye … doomed.”
The minister’s eyelids have been fluttering like moths since the Church of Scotland was stripped of its status as the official religion in Scexit Scotland. “And to think I supported Indy,” he groans.&nbsp;
“The referendum asked ‘Do you believe' …,” the wistful clergyman recalls. “So, of course, I answered YES,” he admits, “… at least on Sundays.</div>

They acknowledge the financial, social and political risks, the defence issues, the global and local problems - and to them, it is still worth it.
They are willing to undergo all that may happen because they fundamentally believe their sacrifice is required for Scotland to break away from the United Kingdom.</div>

There is a gap between how you present yourself - very, very effectively - and what’s really been going on in Scotland.
