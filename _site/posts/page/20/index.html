Or, to put it another way: Scottish Labour has adopted what feels like its 3,432nd position on independence in the past decade. Nothing has revealed Labour’s struggle for relevance north of the border as much as its hokey-cokey on independence. It has gone from a firm “No” in 2014 to a half-hearted “we’d rather not, but maybe”, to “if people vote for it, we can’t deny them the choice”, then back to a firm “No”. </p></div>

<p>From The Express:</p>
<p>NICOLA STURGEON&rsquo;s vision of an independent Scotland would have a &ldquo;cataclysmic&rdquo; impact on the world, a former NATO general secretary claimed in a throwback speech.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Brookings Institute in America, Lord Robertson, who served as Defence Secretary under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.express.co.uk/TONY-BLAIR">Tony Blair</a> between 1997 and 1999, said: &ldquo;Whatever our occasional faults, we are still an anchor of the Western world.The loudest cheers for the break-up of Britain would be from our adversaries and from our enemies.&rdquo;</p></div>
