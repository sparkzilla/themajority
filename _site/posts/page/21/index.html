<p>Asked if Scotland will be independent by then, Sturgeon said: “Everyone knows my view on independence. I want Scotland to be an independent country, I think that brings lots of benefits.</p>
<p>“But that’s not my focus right now. My focus is tackling coronavirus, making sure we are tackling the health implications of the virus by suppressing it and stopping it running out of control again, and doing everything we can to support the economy.</p></div>

Democracy, devolution and subsidiarity should be the driving principles with powerful regional and national governments able to build strong, vibrant, regional and national sustainable communities within a democratised political system where each level of government has clear established and legally binding rights and responsibilities that cannot be taken away at anybody’s whim.</p></div>
