The party won 32 seats in the Scottish Parliament election, up an impressive 19 seats on 2011, pushing Scottish Labour into a humiliating third place and denying the SNP an overall majority. Davidson’s charges followed this up with their best General Election result in three decades in the 2017 General Election, those 13 MPs keeping Theresa May clinging to power in Downing Street.</p></div>

<p>Why then should the  distribute money to those who vote for the SNP or Sinn Féin, when they hate Britain and want to leave? It is pointless to invest in people and jobs that won’t benefit Britain if such people have their way. Why do it moreover when the German Federal court’s decision shows that membership of a mere confederation does not require German money to be sent foreigners. It would neither be sent to those who want to be foreigners.</p></div>
