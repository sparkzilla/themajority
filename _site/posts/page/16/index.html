A few quid perhaps? Maybe ten or twenty quid at a stretch? No… in fact it turns out it costs £357 to change a lightbulb at the Scottish parliament building. Some £1.75 Million was spent on upgrading lights in the devolved assemblies’ debating chamber in 2016-7, working out at an astonishing £357 apiece.
That same year, costs ranged from £25.</div>

They evaporated the illusion of free will, the idea that through grit and determination you can transcend the disadvantages of multiple deprivation and poor schooling. The outcry has been predictable, from individual pupils and parents, politicians on all sides, and educationalists. The latter group warned months ago that the SQA moderation process was dodgy.</div>

My mind went back to her last parent-teacher conference, just as the Coronavirus crisis was starting. Her Computing Science teacher was effusive in praise. ‘I’ll be recommending an A,’ he said.</div>

It’s not a joke, it’s exactly what happened to me two weeks ago.
Until this time, I had never interacted with George Galloway and had never felt any wish to do so. From nowhere, a series of tweets appeared from the former MP, urging pro-UK political parties to form an alliance to defeat the SNP.</div>

#5 Dude, where’s our superfast broadband? Lockdown measures over the last few months have really shown the importance of a reliable and fast broadband connection.

Do you know the Mull of Galloway? The chances are that you don’t; even people who live in Galloway have probably never been there, unless they have a passion for sea birds, or lighthouses. I can recommend it for these two things, plus the seascape, but mainly as a way of exploring one’s inner sense of Britishness. There, standing on the southern-most tip of Scotland, gazing across an empty Irish Sea, once the nexus of trade in these islands for early Britons, you get the sense that, having travelled miles to be somewhere really isolated, you have actually located the centre point of the United Kingdom.</div>

First a couple of definitions.
‘We’ are the good, solid people of Scotland who voted to remain in the UK in 2014.&nbsp;
‘We’ were relieved, rather than triumphalist, about having won the referendum.&nbsp;
‘We’ didn’t rub the losers’ noses in it but tried to appease them. ‘We’ sat back and let the UK government make concessions to the side that had lost.&nbsp;
‘We’ believed Salmond and Sturgeon when they repeatedly told us that the referendum was a ‘once in a generation’, ‘once in a lifetime’ event.</div>
