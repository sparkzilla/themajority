How does this performance compare with its predecessor, the old Scots parliament?
When the new Scottish parliament first met, on 12 May 1999, Dr Winifred Ewing, the “mother of the house”, opened the proceedings by saying, “The Scottish parliament, adjourned on the 25th day of March, 1707, is hereby reconvened.</div>

A festival of penny-pinching opened yesterday, as the newly appointed Finance Minister, Kylie Krankie, launched the inaugural Queen's Awards for Belt-tightening on behalf of the post-Scexit government.
“I’m just bursting to tell everyone!” exclaimed Valerie Spark, after scooping the energy award.

“I lied in good faith.”&nbsp;
With those words, Dr Jim Heckle, the Minister for Strategy in the post-Scexit cabinet, abruptly quit the Scottish government yesterday, citing mental health issues.&nbsp;
“Since Indy, it’s been absolutely pile-driving,” Heckle explained in an exclusive interview with the Sunday Herald. “But the real problem with … y’know … cracking up,” he sobbed, “is that you don’t see it yourself.</div>
