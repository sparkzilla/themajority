                    <div class="post-excerpt">This week, John Swinney launched yet another desperate push to try to break up the UK, this time fronted by a glossy poster declaring:
“Scotland is a nation. We affirm that every nation has the right to choose its own future. We choose a future where Scotland decides its own government…This is our plea, our right, and our opportunity: To place who live here at the heart of our national opportunity: democracy.</div>

                    <div class="post-excerpt">So called pro-UK politicians from both the Conservatives and Labour often trumpet the "Union dividend" — the extra billions Scotland receives from the United Kingdom — as proof that staying in the UK benefits ordinary Scots. On paper, the numbers seem impressive: according to the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) 2024–25 report, Scotland receives £2,669 more per person in public spending than the UK average.
But in reality, this dividend is wasted as under the SNP, Scotland’s extra funding is being squandered on a bloated, inefficient, and politically motivated public sector, while schools, hospitals, and local services continue to decline.</div>

                    <div class="post-excerpt">John Swinney, the current SNP leader, and his predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, have recently resorted to a familiar tactic: invoking youth demographics to justify the party's continued push for Scottish independence. Both have attempted to frame support among 16- to 24-year-olds as proof of an inevitable shift toward separation from the United Kingdom.
In a recent speech at the SNP’s conference, Swinney cited a poll commissioned by The National—the nationalists' propaganda paper —which claimed 63% of 16- to 24-year-olds backed independence.</div>

Despite the intentions behind devolution, the existence of devolved legislatures like Holyrood has amplified the separatist agenda rather than diminished it. To secure the UK, a pragmatic dual strategy—a short-term defense and a long-term solution—is required.

They have to maintain this fiction as any look at the objective, verifiable, empirical facts (data and statistical evidence) gives the conclusion that in ALL parts of the UK, a clear and often substantial majority of the public want to keep the UK together.</div>

This theory was the basis of US and other countries’ foreign policy and helped fuel armed conflicts in the post-1945 period.</div>

                    <div class="post-excerpt">It seems no matter what constitutional problems the UK has, someone will always propose federalism as a solution. But federalism isn't the benign cuddly sheep it first appears to be. It's the nationalist wolf in disguise, ready to divide and devour the UK. Federalism, like all attempts to appease nationalism, will only further aid the fragmentation of the constitutional cohesion of our country, and should be opposed by all those who want to maintain its integrity.</div>

Before a system can be fixed or abolished, we need a clear understanding of the problems and issues of the current system of Legislative Devolution:
Constitutional conflictCentralisationExcessive spendingLack of accountabilityConstitutional Power GrabsIt is a well-known fact that political organisations always aim to expand their power.</div>

                    <div class="post-excerpt">It’s been 25 years since the devolution experiment was inflicted on Scotland, and the result is an unspeakable disaster. It’s a disaster because The Scottish Parliament, which was set up to stop Scottish Nationalism, is now being abused by the SNP to promote a separatist agenda, while Scotland’s services decline daily and scandal mounts up. And it is ‘unspeakable’ because few want to discuss whether the source problem is devolution itself, even its natural opponents.</div>
