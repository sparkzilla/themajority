See schedule below). This campaign aims to let voters know that they have the power to use tactical voting to put an end to 14 years of SNP failure. Research by Scotland Matters shows that up to 500,000 Scottish voters are considering tactical voting. We invite various campaign groups to take advantage of the #VoteTactical hashtag on Twitter. Mark Devlin, founder of the Majority: In this election, ordinary people have the power to put an end to 14 Years of SNP incompetence, corruption, and failure by voting tactically. The SNP is only in power because the opposition support is split. We urge ordinary people to use the power of their vote to support the best candidate to beat the SNP, regardless of their usual party affiliation. This could lead to up to 30 more pro-UK seats, and more importantly, 30 less SNP seats.

That seems hard to believe, given that Nicola Sturgeon admitted, less than two weeks ago, that she and the SNP still have no plan for the economic consequences of what would happen after a successful vote for separation. She gave no plan or vision for how her separated Scotland would manage its affairs, other than vague and completely ludicrous statements. She has no answers on border control, currency and defence or to other quite important questions that voters might ask.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/C4Ciaran/status/1382801138207047680 Listening to these incomprehensible ramblings I cannot help but ask myself, \"what on earth have you all been doing for the past 87 years?” 87 years is a very long time. When you consider that the average life expectancy for a man in Glasgow is, thanks in no small part to the SNP, now as low as 54.6 years (considerably lower than places like Somalia or Mongolia), it’s almost TWO lifetimes! It’s multiple generations. Yet, in all that time, the SNP still hasn’t figured out what their sacred political objective will look like. They can’t even agree on basic issues that can be modelled now, such as which currency to use. Not only have they had 87 years, but the SNP have also now had 14 years in power with access to all the organisational and forecasting institutions that come with it. But they still haven’t produced an accurate, adequate or agreed-upon prospectus (the less said about The White Paper, the better). The reason is simple; the realities of the economic, political and social instability of separation would dissuade all but the most fanatical voter from supporting their plan. So they must evade and lie and obfuscate for their political survival. One might think that Scottish voters would be canny enough to figure out that a party that still doesn\u0027t know what it wants or know what its major policy would look like, doesn’t deserve their support. But then again, perhaps we Scots are not as smart as we like to think we are. The question that now haunts the SNP is: why, after Brexit, Boris Johnson, a dreaded Tory government, and the multitude of things that they told us would boost their support, are they still at the levels of support they had in 2016? We all know the answer: The SNP is not a party that likes to do things, they only like to be seen to do things. They want to be seen as great innovators, revolutionaries and radicals, but their record in government shows that they are the opposite. The SNP don\u0027t innovate, they manage decline, they don\u0027t revolutionise; instead, they languish, and they are reactionary rather than radical. They are contrarian only for the sake of being contrarian because it allows them to permanently occupy the moral high ground without any justification for doing so. Seeing the SNP for what they are, as a contrarian party interested only in promising rather than delivering, it becomes obvious why the SNP has not actually put any real work into showing the electorate a clear picture of what life after secession would be like. But reality can only be hidden for so long. As it inevitably dawns, many cybernats are wising up. Last week, the Bath-based pro-Separation blogger, Stuart Campbell, closed his Wings Over Scotland blog in desperation after years of being dragged along in the vain hope of reaching Nirvana. A fantasy that has as much chance of being true as a cult using a comet to reach another dimension.\u0026nbsp; This month I sat and watched 72 ostensibly pro-indy MSPs be elected again, but this time with my heart breaking, knowing that they would achieve nothing and indeed had no real intention to even try.And I’ve had enough of feeling that way. I’m not going to rehash all the blindingly obvious reasons why there isn’t going to be independence referendum in the life of this Parliament, because we’ve explained them a dozen times and anyone who was ever going to listen already knows. Boris Johnson – or any other Tory leader – has absolutely no reason to allow one and nothing to fear from refusing. Scotland has no influence over him whatsoever...\u0026nbsp;...We told you in May 2016 that the election result took an indyref off the table for five years and we were proved right. We’re telling you again.......So what’s coming now is five miserable years of deja vu. A Holyrood with a pro-indy majority but no will to do anything with it, ...I want no part of the lie they’re going to foist on indy supporters for the next few years. I want no responsibility for how people are going to feel as it slowly, gradually dawns on them that they’ve been conned and taken for fools in exactly the same way Tony Blair did to Labour voters 20 years ago. Ah, well. One could almost feel sad at the loss of hope, except that the rest of us will have to suffer under this cult’s delusions, which Campbell promoted avidly, for several more years. But, this too shall pass. When the SNP is 91 years old, just four years from now, how many more will have come to realise the jig is up? So, next time an SNP devotee angrily and desperately informs you that \u0027independence\u0027 is \"just around the corner\" or that it has \"never been closer\", tell them that Nationalists have been yelling that into the void for the last 87 years, and still have no plan.\u0026nbsp; Because you can rest assured that if the SNP had a viable and attractive plan, they would have spent the last decades shouting it from the rooftops.

Two years ago, a few Aberdeen City and Shire Better Together veterans, including the two chairmen, Ian Lakin and Professor Hugh Pennington (better known as Nicola Sturgeon’s COVID bête noire), got together to create Scotland Matters. We were all agreed that the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections would be the Scexit High Noon and unless Labour, Lib Dem and the Conservatives started looking like an effective opposition and alternative government, the SNP/Greens would again win a majority of seats with a minority of the total vote. Then they would agitate for Indyref2, even if they don’t actually mean it.\u0026nbsp; Our campaign group\u0027s unique selling point was, and is, that the pro-UK parties need to work together to maximise the number of seats between them – ie. endorse tactical voting – and be willing to form a coalition. We also went out of our way to work with other groups.\u0026nbsp; With only six months to go until the Scottish Parliament election, not much has changed, other than a series of biased polls predicting a rout of the pro-UK parties.\u0026nbsp; Scotland Matters believes a growing number of people want the pro-UK party leaders to get serious about tactical voting as a means of getting a Parliament that reflects the 55/45% union majority voting split in their favour. Perfect tactical voting can yield a significant number of seats; anything over 65 will remove the SNP/Green majority. We decided to test our theory.\u0026nbsp; We have an email list of around 1900 people, around 1200 are individuals who have signed up and the rest are pro-UK Councillors, MPs and MSPs. Typically, around 600 open our update emails regularly.\u0026nbsp; Two weeks ago, we sent out a Survey Monkey Poll which asked the question: If the Scottish opposition parties agreed to field only one ‘constituency’ candidate in the Scottish Parliamentary elections in 2021, would you support this and vote for the agreed candidate? A subsidiary question was: Would you support any voting strategy to get the SNP out?\u0026nbsp; Just to be clear, our target audience was pro-UK people because independence-supporting voters are hardly likely to support tactical voting to defeat the SNP/Greens, and our objective was to get some coalface evidence of the appetite for tactical voting if is supported and prompted by the parties themselves,\u0026nbsp; We sent out two identical surveys: to private individuals and the politicians.\u0026nbsp;Almost immediately, we had around 100 responses from the individuals showing 99% in favour. That was obviously from the real enthusiasts, so we waited to see if any more people responded. We got a total of 200 responses and the percentage fell to 98% including 12 politicians’ responses, all in favour. This was tremendous and surprising, so we decided to test further and share the survey link on\u0026nbsp;open\u0026nbsp;pro-UK social media sites.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; We assumed that nationalists spotting it and piling in, and the wider, albeit still pro-UK, audience would dilute and reduce the percentage in favour.\u0026nbsp;In fact, the number of respondents went up to 860 and the percentage in favour fell only slightly to 96%. This encouraged us to go for a bigger sample so, as a third test, we debated whether to commission a proper professionally run poll, or “boost” the survey on Facebook.\u0026nbsp;We spent £200 to “boost” it on Facebook to a rough combination of Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative voters, Express and Sun readers. It was seen by 21,000 people.\u0026nbsp; We received a further 1000 responses, bringing the total to 1891, four times what we would get on a professional poll.\u0026nbsp;The percentage went down to 93.4% , while 70% said yes to the “would you support any voting strategy to get the SNP out” question.\u0026nbsp; We have still to do a professional poll and the cheapest way to do this would be to insert our question in an “omnibus” poll, whereby it is included in a regular poll with other organisations’ questions to a representative panel of 1000 people. By definition, this would survey around 550 people who voted NO in 2014.\u0026nbsp; I’m no statistician, psephologist, pollster or professional politician, but so far our self-selecting survey looks to me like a clear message from a very random sample of Scotland’s two million NO voters that they want the parties to get their act into gear and save themselves, and Scotland, from -- let’s be honest -- near destruction of the parties and our country as we know it.\u0026nbsp; Roughly 10% of individuals who saw our poll responded and almost 100% were in favour. What if we could have reached 10% of two million NO voters and even 70% of them had been in favour, and these 140,000 had clear guidance and voted tactically as optimally as possible?\u0026nbsp; This would surely have a significant, potentially election winning, Scotland saving effect.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Allan Sutherland is the Director of Scotland Matters.

It\u0027s a match-winner","url":"/articles/a-british-premiership-its-a-match-winner/","content":"This article was originally published in Think Scotland. The biggest single thing that could be done to cement the union between Scotland and England would be for Celtic and Rangers to join The Premiership. I have pressed this case upon every Prime Minister since Tony Blair. You may say I have a taste for hyperbole from time to time. It is true I have sometimes hailed a starling as an eagle or even denounced a blackbird as a vulture but this time I\u0027m not exaggerating. By and large, supporters of Rangers are loyal to the Union. If someone tells you they are a Rangers supporter and a Separatist they probably support Brora rather than the Glasgow variety. By and large – and this is an historic shift – supporters of Celtic nowadays vote largely for the SNP.\u0026nbsp; Roman Catholics of an Irish background, like me – until not more than twenty years ago – were the least likely Scottish Nationalists. Frankly, we feared the rest of you. We felt that if you could you\u0027d take our schools and our religious liberties too. We were scarred by the near past, a past of bigotry and discrimination against us. I can sum it up in one anecdote: St Pats in Coatbridge in the school-lives of my erstwhile comrades Helen Liddle (nee Reilly) as she then was and John Reid (as he then was) were given a half-day\u0027s holiday to celebrate the first Catholic in Coatbridge getting a job in a bank. But we feared the SNP more than anyone else. We knew that their founders Gibb and Donaldson were anti-Irish racists and anti-Catholic bigots (quite apart from being Hitler-loving Quislings the latter of whom had to be locked up during the War) but we also saw the 1970s leader of the SNP, William Wolfe, promise to stand at the border and seek to block the Papal Nuncio\u0027s entry into Scotland to discuss a Papal visit! For today\u0027s younger Scottish Catholic of Irish descent supporting separatism is becoming an article of faith. Not so much faith in an Independent Scotland as faith in an Independent and United Ireland.\u0026nbsp; The fight against the British state – having ended by negotiation in Ireland -–is now vicariously played out in Scotland. How can such a profound shift be reversed? Well, there is one way. At least a quarter of a million people – like me – belong to what might be called the Celtic Community. Our team was the first British side to win the European Cup. We belong in the big time. We are tired (up to a point) of winning the Scottish Premiership every year – this season\u0027s will be our tenth in a row. If the British state could prevail upon The Premiership to admit Celtic and Rangers in the way they have in the past admitted Cardiff City and Swansea then the whole Celtic and Rangers \"communities\" – perhaps half a million Scots – would be watching their teams play Manchester United and Liverpool regularly rather than Livingstone and St Johnstone. They would be travelling to away games, big travelling support from the great English teams would be travelling here, and the massive increase in income accrued could help compensate Livingston and St Johnstone for the loss of gate money from visits by the \"Old Firm\". We would be in a British League, thinking British again, and anxious to keep it that way. And a \"New Firm\" could rise again, the Scottish Cups, the Scottish Premiership winnable again, by Aberdeen, Hibs, Hearts, Dundee United and maybe others. Scottish football would no longer be a one or even two horse race. Everyone would be a winner from that. Especially the Union. George Galloway is the leader of Alliance For Unity.

Don’t get me wrong - I don’t break laws, but I am prepared to ‘think outside the box’ and look at things in a different way, if something doesn’t feel right. And I am not alone, as many of the great inventions and medical/scientific breakthroughs have happened because someone dared to look at things differently from the general population and the peers in their field. And I find myself in a similar situation today regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the methods being chosen by many countries, including Scotland and the rest of the UK, for dealing with it. Although recent progress towards a vaccine is welcome, until it becomes readily available --which may realistically not happen for several months -- the public is having to deal with the Government\u0027s handling of the virus. One issue of particular concern is their constant depiction of COVID as a “terrible disease“, a “killer virus“ and a “huge threat“ to public health throughout the world. Now, I’m not suggesting that the disease is harmless to everyone, or that every death does not have its own tragic circumstances, but such pronouncements would lead one to conclude that it is horribly affecting and killing a large proportion of the world’s population. That is far from the truth, however, as the total number of people who have been reported as dying around the world from (or with) COVID-19 is just over one million, which sounds high, but is actually around 1 in 7000 people. Even allowing for omissions in the numbers in some countries, it is a long way short of even 1 in 1000.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It is far from devastating for a global pandemic, especially when you consider that these numbers include many countries where the virus has “ripped through“ great swathes of the population, because the Governments have been unable (or even unwilling) to shield people from it, and where the medical facilities have been significantly less extensive and capable than those in developed countries.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; There are many more statistics available that confirm that the disease is almost innocuous for healthy people. The following figures are up until the end of October and relate to the UK, but similar figures apply to many of the world’s populations: Only a handful of children under age 18 (roughly one in a million) have died of COVID, and all of them had serious underlying health conditions The COVID death rate for people under age 65 was about 1 in 9,000 About 75% of COVID deaths relate to people over 75. This still represents only about 0.5% of the over 75s in the UK and, of these deaths, about 90% had serious underlying conditions About 80% of all people who test positive are symptom free and only 5% develop worse than moderate symptoms COVID is not even in the top 10 most frequent underlying causes of death in the UK and, in October, accounted for only about 7% of total deaths. And yet, despite all of the above statistics, the UK Governments, their advisers and the media continue to instil fear about the disease, and act as if it is having (and will continue to have) a “disastrous” effect on everyone within the country..\u0026nbsp; Now, I recognise that things have got worse since the end of October, but they are still nowhere near to the type of devastating levels portrayed, and do not justify locking down entire regions or cities containing millions of people if they have more than 100 positive cases (not deaths which are much lower) per 100,000 people (i.e. 0.1% of the local population). Indeed, the recognised UK alert threshold for ‘regular’ acute respiratory infections is normally 400 cases per 100,000, and there are also serious doubts about the accuracy of the tests, with many picking up virus traces long after an infection has gone. It would therefore be a real step forward in generating trust and understanding, if the Governments would be much more open with the public why they are taking such drastic action, instead of just imposing the restrictions and saying they are \"following the science”. At a minimum, both they, and their advisers, should outline the models they have used and the assumptions they have made in reaching their decisions, so that other experts (like myself) could review these and work out if they are reasonable and appropriate. I, like many others, cannot see how an infection rate of 0.1% justifies locking down millions of people. Indeed, using lockdowns to control the spread of the virus is like using a giant wrecking ball to crack a nut. Lockdowns cause more damage to communities than the issues they resolve, as they actually worsen public health by adding mental, physical and emotional stresses, causing the curtailment of operations for other more serious diseases and bringing about disastrous effects on people’s finances, jobs and the economy.\u0026nbsp; Lockdowns also instill suspicion and fear of our fellow citizens and destroy the well-being that comes from normal living, theatres, crowds, holidays etc. In Scotland, we have seen Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s daily briefings and arbitrary tiers, all of which seem unecessarily compex at best, and appear to be designed simply to create as much division with the UK as possible. In addition, they prevent immunity building up and merely delay the spread of the virus, rather than stopping it. And as soon as the conditions are relaxed, the number of cases goes up and the whole miserable process starts again. Now I acknowledge that we need to ensure that the NHS is not stretched and that we should not just abandon restrictions altogether, but there are alternative strategies to lockdowns that are likely to achieve better outcomes at much reduced physical and financial costs. In particular, the Great Barrington Declaration outlines an alternative strategy that would minimise the dangers for people at high and at low risk of mortality from Covid. For example, higher-risk people (mainly older people over 70) would be protected by devoting overwhelming resources and ingenuity to the cause of preventing exposure to infected Covid patients.\u0026nbsp;And the health and well-being of lower risk people would be greatly improved by permitting them to resume their normal lives. Given the eminent people who proposed the Declaration and those who have subsequently signed it, I find it both strange and unfair that there has been such hostility from many quarters to the idea of even debating the proposals. The Declaration is not perfect, but, it is much better than the endless lockdown measures that have been used, and continue to be used - largely unsuccessfully - by the UK and many other governments. At the very least it should be properly and fairly debated and compared with lockdowns, incorporating both the health and economic implications. The public should then be allowed to choose if they think it provides a better solution for getting our lives back again and living with the disease, in the same way as we already do with flu, cancer, heart and other respiratory diseases.

For the SNP, it was a knife thrust deep into their back, and for Unionists, it was the joy of watching an enemy devour itself. Alba\u0027s hype — that it will somehow game the system and end up with an unchallengeable majority — is the ravings of a vindictive and ego-driven man high on his own supply.\u0026nbsp; For his hare-brained scheme to work, Salmond needs the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon, to agree to work with him. That\u0027s right; he needs to convince a party that has built its identity around progressive social issues to work with a man who, despite being acquitted, has admitted to \"sleepy cuddles\".\u0026nbsp; A man who, only days ago, was demanding his alleged persecutors resign en masse from the government, while accusing his new supposed ally of breaking the ministerial code. A woman, and a government, who he believes engaged in a conspiracy to have him imprisoned, described him as a “gambler” and his supporters as \"cronies\". That\u0027s hardly a solid base for a political collaboration. Salmond has to convince SNP voters to break the SNP\u0027s mantra of \"Both votes SNP\u0027\u0027 because he will never get any votes from anti-Nationalist voters. This brings him into direct conflict with the SNP, escalating his previous cold war into a hot (un)civil war. If you’re a Nationalist you might think that voters’ highest priority is ‘independence’, but polls consistently say the constitutional issue is low on most voters’ priorities. Polls also say that most people don\u0027t want a referendum in the next few years. But Salmond’s Alba party puts the constitution right up front by claiming the SNP is not serious about secession. To prove they are indeed the vehicle for separation, the SNP will have to continuously affirm their commitment to a second referendum. And to hold one quickly. This is a turn off to many soft voters who want stability after the pandemic. Every concession Salmond forces from the SNP will open the way for more attacks. He will use all the secrets and insider information he has amassed on the SNP, information that was going to be part of his book, which Jim Sillars described as \"a volcano going off under the SNP\". Despite claims that he is “moving on”, Salmond will ensure that Nicola Sturgeon’s damaging scandals remain in the public consciousness and that the SNP remain seen as more divided than ever.\u0026nbsp; Nicola Sturgeon wanted to go into the election claiming she’s a capable pair of hands (she isn’t), who has brought Scotland through the pandemic safely (she hasn’t) but now she has to deal with a man out for revenge, who will force her to talk about an issue she doesn’t want to talk about, while reminding everyone of her administration\u0027s corruption. It’s almost Shakespearean. Voters won’t see Alba as a new party, but rather a breaking apart of the SNP, and voters punish divided parties. Can you imagine the televised debates? A Jeremy Kyle meets Judge Judy circus, playing out as a national psychodrama can only damage the secessionist cause. Even if Nicola Sturgeon cooperates, she will be punished for it. How would her moderates, or those who vote for her on the basis of various social issues, view her forming an alliance with a man with such a reputation? They would not stand for it. They will either not vote, or head to the other parties that have taken the SNP\u0027s side on issues such as the GRA and the Hate Crime Bill, namely Labour. Nicola Sturgeon and her rump SNP are stuck between a rock and a hard place with all paths leading to lost voters.\u0026nbsp; And spare a thought for the Greens, who have so loyally supported Sturgeon through recent votes of no confidence, only to be wiped out by Salmond’s belligerence. They won’t go quietly either. The fighting multiplies and the voters look on in disdain. Despite the doomsday cries coming from some anti-Nationalists, this is the best possible situation that could have happened, short of Alex Salmond drawing a Claymore and charging into Holyrood looking for Nicola’s head. Yes, the Scottish Tories are beating the drum of an electoral agreement, but if they really wanted one, it would be done through back channels and not with an open letter. Scottish Labour will surely benefit most from Nationalist disaffection. So, don\u0027t worry about the chances of a super-majority, because if this plan had any real chance of working, you could bet that the SNP would have tried it already. Instead, vote for the party most likely to beat the SNP in your region and load up on the popcorn and marshmallows, because this fire will burn bright and long, leaving only faint ashes behind it.

Be it by the sun\u0027s movement and the need to care for cattle or the morning commute to your 9-5 job, time impacts us all, but we experience it in different ways. One concept is that of time dilation, where the passage of time is different in two bodies depending on the velocity at which they travel; think of the masterful movie\u0026nbsp;Interstellar, where the protagonist in space experiences time much slower than his daughter on earth so that when they meet again, he seems not to have aged at all while his daughter is on her death bed from old age. As abstract as this may seem, time dilation is very relevant to politics, especially in a time where our days seem to drag on. As many others have noted, this has been a very punishing week for the SNP and for Nicola Sturgeon. Last Monday, support for Separation, while falling, was still ahead in weighted polls. Her administration seemed to be holding together, and her legacy assured. Now this lies in tatters. Secession is behind; in a survey taken before many of the events of this past week, her administration is tearing itself apart, her apparatchiks face votes of no confidence on several issues, and more scandalous revelations occur by the hour. A week is a long time in politics. In that time, the SNP have gone from the crowd favourite to the punching bag. Once-loyal commentators have turned against them, scandals are piling up, the opposition has new drive and leadership, and the nation is growing tired of its incompetence.\u0026nbsp; You have, no doubt, read many accounts of the events of the last week, but how do they affect the public perception and social position of Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP? The first is that it impacts the electorate’s political momentum. After 14 years of the SNP\u0027s disastrous tenure, some supporters already have doubts about the SNP, be that their record in office, their commitment to ideological goals and social policies, or just boredom with them as a party. However, thus far, they have always had a personal reason to suspend those beliefs. The SNP’s support is like a boulder, held back from rolling down the steep hill of voter enthusiasm, by small stones that are wedged underneath it. Each small stone represents a policy that is important to voters; for some, it may be education, for others health care, ideology or perhaps no particular reason. And each stone is held in with a different amount of force. It is buried to the hilt for some, and for others, it is only gently placed. Each new story that breaks about the SNP is like water and wind flowing past the stones, eroding their support. When Nicola Sturgeon is shown to have misled parliament; when the SNP have failed in education, healthcare, the economy; their lack of transparency; and so on and on and on, their support is weakened. How much more bad news will it take to remove them? Once one small stone goes, the boulder starts to tip. The SNP were once very good at pushing the boulder back into position, their empty promises kept their supporters loyal. But the stones were, nonetheless, weakened. For the fanatical secessionist, the SNP’s promises for a \"plan B\" coup don\u0027t cut it. For everyone else, the simple truth rings out: if you haven’t been able to achieve your promises in 14 years, how on earth can you be expected to achieve them in the next five? Let’s add another precariously-balanced boulder on top of the first, engraved with the letters C.O.V.I.D. In times like this, out of desperation, the SNP turn to their charismatic leader to rally the troops, but after weeks of wall-to-wall coverage of scandal, cover-up, lying and deflection, the SNP is left without its most powerful weapon. Sturgeon can’t push back this time. The boulder is moving. The SNP have lost their mechanism for holding and attracting voters. Their record in government and the events of the last few weeks have loosened the grip of many retaining stones throughout the country. As the small stones crumble, the boulder starts rolling down the hill at ever-increasing speeds. The SNP is powerless to stop the mad chaos of political gravity.","date":"2021-03-02","summary":"Time is a unique concept; it is a variable constant that has come to dominate everyone\u0027s lives on this planet.

Rob McCratchit, his so-called ‘special advisor,’ had taken a day off and now – dammit – the Finance Minister had to write his own seasonal message. ‘Happy Scotsmas to one and all …’ Crivvens!! Stuck already. Where the hell was McCratchit when you really needed him? Sighing deeply, McScrooge rested his leaden head against the monitor until his thoughts drifted onto … “Wakey-wakey!” McScrooge jerked back to life. “Fear not,” a gravelly voice intoned, giving his chains a shake. “I am the Ghost of Scotsmas Past, ready to show you the good ol’ days.” And it was true. There on screen, a thousand cheering faces gazed upwards at his old campaign speech: “… and let us stuff it to the Westminster doom-mongers. Our time is bloody-well-now!”\u0026nbsp; McScrooge radiated pride. Happy days! A clear enemy – it made all the difference.\u0026nbsp; “Sweet, eh?” said the Ghost of Scotsmas Past. “All that power – without the pesky responsibility!” McScrooge eased into a foggy glen of nostalgia till – with an almighty jolt – he was spooked by yet another spook. “Yikes!!” “You’ve guessed it!” the motherly voice intoned. “I am the Ghost of Scotsmas Present.” “Ooh, a present!” gasped McScrooge.\u0026nbsp; “If only,” she smiled, tinkling her chains, “but let’s take a peek at how happily things are going now.” McScrooge licked his lips. This would be good. There on screen, a hunched man scrolled though all his fiscal spreadsheets.\u0026nbsp; “… and once we receive the IMF loan, it’ll all balance out,” he says to his nodding officials. Silence. “But Minister …” a wavering voice pipes up, “the loan has been t-t-turned down.” Silence.\u0026nbsp; “We t-t-tried to negotiate, but we couldn’t persuade …” “Couldn’t …” growls McScrooge “… or damn-well WOULDN’T.” The table shudders as his fist crashes down. “OUT!!” he yells. “OUT!! That’s an order!!” Drenched in his own spittle, the livid minister turns to McCratchit. “T-t-t-t-traitors!” he stutters as his whole body crumples in defeat. “The budget is lost … LOST!!” A ghostly hand rested on McScrooge’s shoulder as he gaped at the screen: “Independence. It’s what you always wanted.”\u0026nbsp; “But you said happy.” “Your dream came true,” replied the ghost. “Power with responsibility.”\u0026nbsp; “B-but-but …” McScrooge stuttered, “… it’s the Westminster government … they’re up to their old tricks. After Indy, we offered them the hand of friendship, but they cut the funding during the transition discussions and even though we negotiated hard …” The lights flickered. The ghostly apparition was fading, fainter and fainter until all that was left was “… zzzz …” “For cryin’ out loud,” McScrooge wailed. “You’re supposed to be scaring me out of my wits and all you can do is snore.” “HEY!” cried a piccolo voice, piercing through the air. McScrooge blanched. “Scotsmas Future here,” the teenage voice shrieked, jingling her chains like a rapper. “I’m bringin’ you all that happy time travel stuff.” McScrooge looked up quizzically. “Happy? You mean, really happy?” “See for yourself, mista.” And she was right. There on screen, all those cheering faces were back again – thousands of patriots waving the Lion Rampant. McScrooge almost risked a smile as he turned up the volume to hear their chants. “Crooks and thieves, out-out-OUT!” “They’re chasin’ you out of office,” noted the wee ghost, “right after Orkney and Shetland dumped you.” McScrooge’s face sagged like his oil revenues. “Deal with it, man,” the spooky voice suggested. “You got NO more power … and NO more responsibility.”\u0026nbsp; The lights died. Another electricity cut – more windmill maintenance issues.\u0026nbsp; Deep in darkness, McScrooge picked up the phone, jabbing at the number. “Bob, where the hell are you?” he barked. “Take ten days off,” McScrooge insisted.\u0026nbsp; “Ten days!” exclaimed Bob. “Who cares?” McScrooge exclaimed. “In the end, it won’t be our responsibility.”\u0026nbsp; At long last, a smile cracked across McScrooge’s face just in time to dash off his final Scotmas message. “Happy humbuggery!!”","date":"2020-12-24","summary":"The Scexit Files : (Scottish Review of Books, 20th Dec. 2030) “Bloody humbuggery!” muttered McScrooge as the lights flickered ominously.

It is what we have feared all along: the formation of a ‘Nationalist Front’ and a creeping Ulsterisation of Scottish politics with Salmond already talking about ‘street protests’ as part of their campaign for secession. The big question is: will a nationalist monster with two heads be harder to slay, or will those heads devour each other? *** Our candidates had been trolled aggressively by angry candidates from the main parties producing ever more fanciful charts to show that we would replace their candidates in list seats. They all seemed oblivious to the fact that if it came down to the main parties worrying about list seats we would have lost anyway and be off to Catalonia with Sturgeon and Salmond.\u0026nbsp; The Alba party’s strategy to maximise wasted votes on the list makes a mockery of these squabbles. The notion that the big parties have some sort of loser’s entitlement to seats on the list after failing to win constituency seats – because they in turn have split the pro-UK vote three ways - is the politics of the absurd. *** George took part in the Scotsman regional hustings for the South of Scotland, winning the debate hands down, although I may be biased in that opinion. Certainly, the newspaper devoted most of their report to him when they wrote it up. The other candidates spent most of the debate attacking George. When the Tory candidate accused George of splitting the vote, George noted that his accuser was helping the SNP by not standing down in East Lothian — a winnable Labour seat. Bizarrely, the Tory replied that Labour and the Tories were neck-and-neck in the 2019 General Election. But that’s a different constituency with different boundaries. Apples compared to pears. It’s no wonder people regard politicians as untrustworthy. *** As our team works together, it is becoming more and more apparent that there is far more that unites us than divides us. We come from nearly every party in Scotland yet there’s been no hint of any of the disagreements we had anticipated. George and I were a little wary of each other to start with. He has been battling all his political life on a different side to me on most issues. Perhaps we will again one day. But I am sure we will remain friends and we surprise each other daily by how much we agree on.\u0026nbsp; If George and I can agree on the big issues facing Scotland, it makes the animosity between a Scottish Labour Party led by a privately-educated millionaire businessman and a Scottish Tory party led by a state educated former farm worker seem ridiculous. Politics of the absurd again. *** Sometimes Scottish politics seems like one of those sociological experiments where a group of normal people are given different rosettes and put into groups and are then observed to start hating each other.\u0026nbsp; I put this hypothesis to one of my lefty friends and he tells me that so many people growing up in the Central Belt during the Thatcher era will never ever vote Tory. In his street, families went from having their fathers in jobs to having unemployed dads in an instant, and many never worked since.\u0026nbsp; It’s a fair point but, when you look at what might happen to Scottish employment prospects if the Nationalist Front succeeds, surely two wrongs don’t make a right? *** Some commentators claimed that we ‘don’t exist outside Twitter’. If that is so, why bother to attack us? Even so, it’s a big challenge to get our message out through other media. But when you analyse what Twitter is you come to an uncomfortable conclusion. Twitter is peopled by journalists and George and I are followed by nearly every newspaper and TV editor in Scotland. Some quote our tweets, which are the modern equivalent of press releases, many still do not. Could there be sections of the media who don’t want us to succeed, either because they are pro-independence or because, like the political parties they support, they too are tribal? It’s a chicken and egg situation. To be continued... Jamie Blackett is leader of All for Unity (the Alliance for Unity).

The more secession becomes impractical, and even prohibitively so, the more they are determined to talk about it.\u0026nbsp; The SNP have failed to stop Brexit. Their alternative offers even more disruption. Their vaccination policy is lagging behind other parts of the UK, even though they claim the opposite. The COVID payouts they are responsible for have failed to materialise; the E.U. has rebutted their advances and their prized First Minister, their only person of note, is facing a civil war and a fight for her political existence. The SNP are at a crossroads. They are turning on one another as they face the genuine possibility that they might have to face an election on the record of what little they have achieved compared with so much they have promised. It makes for grim reading.\u0026nbsp; The growing SNP civil war is now open for all to see. It is being played out daily on social media and in the press, as the respective camps draw the battle lines in a situation which can only be described as \"The People\u0027s Front of Judea\" vs \"The Judean People\u0027s Front\". As more mainstream news outlets, both within and outside of Scotland take notice, it erodes their credibility and people start to question what else they have been lying about. Remember, this is the same party that hounded ministers out of the office for minor infractions that wouldn\u0027t make the back page of the national news. For the SNP, life after Brexit seems likely to include life after Nicola.\u0026nbsp; The SNP vultures are circling. Nationalists the world over aren\u0027t well known for their loyalty, but out of all possible candidates, none could even hold a candle to the reputation of the \"current\", as Alex Salmond puts it, FM. Who could replace her? The insurance-less driving transport minister now responsible for enforcing the law? The woefully under qualified finance minister brought in after the last one developed a scandalous and predatory texting habit? The Westminster Braveheart, a perpetual bore and despised for his role in the untimely passing of one of Scotland\u0027s most popular politicians? The education minister who bungled the exams, had two votes of no-confidence chaired against him and oversaw laptops that could not run the correct software? The health minister who insists the \"facts are the facts are the facts\" despite not knowing them herself? The same one who oversaw the pointless deaths of thousands of the most vulnerable in our society and still fails to get them vaccinated now? Or any other of the assorted fanatics, dreamers, wanderers and charlatans? It\u0027s rapidly dawning on many that life without Nicola means life without the SNP.\u0026nbsp; Add this political cluster bomb to the countless other social, economic, political and medical failures and one rapidly sees that the SNP are petrified of fighting an election on actual results. No wonder the SNP have started to reach out frantically to every newspaper, online blog, rogue politician, and \"expert\" they can lay their hands on, because without their only policy, without Separation, they are truly dead in the water.\u0026nbsp; Brexit has caused some difficulties, but nothing like the calamity the SNP hoped for. The vaccine, our best chance at ending this horrifying pandemic, is being rolled out in the UK in a manner that shames the EU and its red tape. EU nations are in open revolt, having to fend for themselves. The Conservatives can now point to the vaccine and \"getting on with our future\" to justify themselves, just as Labour can point south to its dull, but increasingly popular and competent new leader to show they are in fact \"under new leadership\".\u0026nbsp; In Scotland, the Lib-dems can point to some of their standout figures, such as Alex Cole-Hamilton who has made a name for himself in the Salmond debacle.\u0026nbsp; But what can the SNP point to? They can\u0027t say \"judge us on our record\", and soon they may not be able to say \"judge us on our leader\", but only \"judge us on our ideology\", which seems more fantastical and outlandish with every day that passes.\u0026nbsp; The SNP are in trouble, and they know it. The more this open wound of an inquiry goes on, the deeper the erosion of public trust will be. With Sturgeon gone, they have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide. But, remember: a wounded animal is at its most dangerous as it acts out of desperation, and this animal will not go down without a fight. Still, with each passing day, the party\u0027s wounds fester, its strength is sapped and it loses discipline, and the ability to rally support. Don\u0027t expect a big bang finale, but rather a slow and pitiful demise.","date":"2021-01-14","summary":"A curious paradox is occurring within the SNP and the broader Separation movement.

Warning signs such as an earthquake at sea, or the tide suddenly going out, are usually enough to galvanise the inhabitants of neighbouring coastal towns to immediately head for the high ground. Political tsunamis have striking similarities to the real thing. For example, there were many early warning signs before the 2015 General Election that alerted all pro-UK parties in Scotland to the very real possibility that they were going to be swept away by a gigantic nationalist tidal wave. Those warning signs consisted of 1,617,989 bitterly disappointed Independence supporters who voted Yes and had seen their dream of an independent Scotland overwhelmingly crushed at the previous year’s referendum champing at the bit – just waiting for another chance to cock a snook at Westminster. Secondly, the unopposed election of Nicola Sturgeon, further re-energised and emboldened that support when, like a rock star, she embarked on a rally tour of six Scottish cities, selling out every venue, including Glasgow’s 12,000 seater Hydro Arena in less than 24 hours.\u0026nbsp; Political tsunamis like referendums on Scottish independence are seen as a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. However, could it be that we are now witnessing the early stages of another major shift in the tectonic plates of Scottish politics which has its origins rooted not in the result of the 2014 Referendum but in potential criminality firmly embedded within the unaudited financial accounts of the SNP?\u0026nbsp; The missing £666,000 of crowdfunded donations to fight a second independence referendum; the loan of £107,620 to the SNP by CEO, Peter Murrell; the resignation of successive SNP treasurers; the resignation last September of Johnston Carmichael the SNP auditors; the inability to recruit new auditors; the arrest of CEO Peter Murrell and former treasurer, Colin Beattie. Each of these events on its own provides an early warning alert to possible major irregularities within party finances, however, when they are all put together, they have the synergistic potential to do irreparable financial and reputational damage to the party.\u0026nbsp; Most ominously of all, in February this year,, the SNP applied to the Electoral Commission for a deadline extension in order to give the Party more time to submit its Holyrood account, making the chance of it not being able to find an auditor to audit its £4.5 million funds before the 7th July deadline, a very real possibility.\u0026nbsp; Jessica Insall, a former auditor, warned on BBC’s 7 days political show, that being strapped financially, the SNP was not an attractive proposition for any auditor to take on, due to the risk of reputational damage to the auditor should the SNP accounts not be in order. Furthermore, should any auditor take the risk of auditing the SNP accounts, Insall reckons that the fee that they would demand, would be so inflated in order to reflect that risk, that the SNP couldn’t afford the price.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; So, what are the immediate consequences for the SNP should they miss their July 7th Electoral Commission deadline to hand in their audited Holyrood account? Possible sanctions available to the Electoral Commission are three-fold. The party could incur an automatic fine ranging between £250 - £20,000 for missing the deadline.\u0026nbsp; Secondly, under powers obtained under Section 43 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act of 2000, the Commission could also appoint a qualified auditor to audit overdue accounts which would be an unprecedented event In British politics and recover the cost from party funds, thus wielding another major financial blow to SNP finances.\u0026nbsp; If that were not calamitous enough, in the event of the party’s Holyrood branch going bankrupt, Professor James Mitchell, a Scottish Parliamentary expert, argues that all Holyrood SNP MSPs would have to relinquish their Party membership and declare as Independent MSPs instead. This scenario would spark electoral mayhem and fuel enormous public and political pressure from the unionist parties for a fresh Holyrood election, which Mitchell argues that the party could resist if its Bute House agreement with the Greens remains intact.\u0026nbsp; If that wasn’t bad enough, the consequences for the Westminster group of 45 SNP MPs who have also been ditched by former SNP Auditors, Johnston Carmichael appear to be potentially catastrophic for party finances.\u0026nbsp; Penny Mordaunt, Leader of the House of Commons recently stated that if an audited account of SNP’s Westminster spending is not presented to the Electoral Commission by May 31st the party’s £1.15 million of Short money, which is paid out by Westminster to fund the activities of all opposition parties, will cease, putting\u0026nbsp; the party’s future as a going concern in major peril. Short money enables the Party’s 45 MPs to carry out their parliamentary duties including paying their staff and providing funding for travel and associated expenses.\u0026nbsp; There must now be a major doubt as to whether the SNP can raise up to £100,000 to fight the forthcoming Rutherglen \u0026amp; Hamilton West by by-election, which will likely be called shortly. Although it would depend of course on how much was left of the £586,000 the Westminster Group had in its bank account at the end of 2021 to fund this.\u0026nbsp; But the most worrying question of all for the SNP must be: do they have enough funds left to raise the necessary £28,500 to pay their deposits which are required if the party is to fight every seat in each of Scotland’s 57 Scottish parliamentary constituencies? The General Election could be called any time within the next 21 months. If it was able to fund this, how much financial support from the Party would each candidate expect from the Party to fight their campaign? Would that funding be enough to match that spent by their competitors?\u0026nbsp; All this takes place in the light of the unfolding slow-burn drama of potential criminality. Police hunting SIM cards associated with burner phones; purchase of a top of the range deluxe mobile home; luxury pens worth £500; and threats to confiscate phones after concerns raised by an NEC member are just a few of the most recent sensational developments.\u0026nbsp; One could be forgiven for thinking that this was part of a plot from the latest thriller written by Nicola Sturgeon’s favourite crime writer – Val McDermid, but no, this is a real soap opera being acted out very publicly demonstrating to a gobsmacked electorate just how far Scotland’s largest party has fallen in such a short space of time. All of the above is destroying trust in the SNP. Trust in a party and its leadership\u0026nbsp; is probably the most precious of all political commodities: so difficult to earn, yet so easy to lose. There is little doubt that trust in Nicola Sturgeon, was probably one of the main reasons behind the unprecedented electoral success enjoyed by the SNP since her election in 2014. Even since she stood down, Sturgeon’s popularity appears to be unaffected by recent revelations. 53% (+3) of respondents saying she was a good leader compared to 31% saying she was a bad leader.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; However, the former leader’s integrity has already been tarnished by a leaked NEC video from March 2021 where she stated that “the party has never been in a stronger financial position as it is in now’’. \u0026nbsp; Further revelations suggest that she has threatened to seize mobile phones of SNP officials after they raised concerns about party funds. If those revelations are making the hierarchy of the SNP distinctly nervous, the thought of Nicola Sturgeon being imminently arrested is causing them acute apoplexy, with one senior MSP, quoted by The Sunday Times, resorting to the vernacular, ‘’People are shiteing it about what happens then’’. In the two months since Sturgeon’s resignation, support for the SNP at Holyrood has tanked by 9%. Which begs the question: will Scexit support also plummet as a result of her resignation? Surprisingly support for Scexit appears to have been unaffected so far. However, focus group research carried out by These Islands, in 2020, comprising of a sample of No to Yes switchers, found that unswerving belief in Nicola Sturgeon’s leadership was the most important reason for their switch. One wonders if that unswerving belief is so resilient that it could withstand the damage done to her reputation if the former First Minister was arrested? In marked contrast to his predecessor’s unprecedented high levels of popularity, the most recent poll overwhelmingly demonstrates that Humza Yousaf is viewed as an incompetent and weak leader who has approval ratings of -25 and who deserves his moniker - Humza Useless.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It beggars belief that the current First Minister had no idea about the perilous state of his party’s finances when he decided to stand as\u0026nbsp; Sturgeon’s ‘continuity candidate’, in the recent SNP leadership election, bearing in mind that the crisis had been unfolding over six years.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Like a pre tsunami warning of a low tide suddenly rapidly receding out of sight, the first- and second- choice continuity candidates, Angus Robertson and John Swinney bolted for the high ground, stating that they would not be putting their names forward to lead the party, leaving hapless Humza rooted to the spot, apparently oblivious to the humongous wave of sleaze and corruption about to engulf him and his party.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; We are now at the end of the beginning of the most sensational political story in Scotland so far this century. As Nationalists with a penchant for speaking faux Scots would call it, a proper clusterbourach. This gathering storm of potential criminality, bankruptcy, unrepairable reputational damage, and incompetent leadership threatens to create a tsunami of unprecedented strength. The power of which could not only cause the first political extinction event that UK politics has ever witnessed, but it could also provide a unique opportunity to stop calls for the break up fo the UK, and to end the Nationalist hegemony at Westminster, Holyrood and at local Council level once and for all.

With many years before the next \u0027once-in-a-generation\u0027 vote, Blackett argues that it makes sense to work out the rules in advance. These rules would apply to any Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish referenda and should be seen, not as roadblocks, but as paths to legitimacy. The Act should: #1 - Define the procedure for requesting a referendum\u0026nbsp; Currently, there is no rule on when a referendum can be requested. The SNP like to say that a majority of seats at Holyrood elections in 2021 will give them a mandate to call for a second independence referendum. But, in their coalition with the Greens, the SNP already have a majority of seats in Holyrood, and their repeated calls for a second referendum have been blocked: even if the SNP get a majority without the Greens, the UK Government\u0027s response will therefore not change.\u0026nbsp; The plain fact is that calling a referendum is reserved to the UK Government, and there is no need to indulge those who lost the previous referendum.\u0026nbsp; But, but, the polls? Just today, a poll from Survation says that only 28% of respondents said a second referendum is a priority at this time, with 68% saying it is not. Polls come and go, but Separation is permanent. One suggestion is to base any mandate on the popular vote. There is an illusion that SNP represents the majority of voters in Scotland. In fact, anti-Nationalist parties represented 52% of the vote in the 2019 General Election, but due to the first-past-the-post system, the SNP won the majority of seats.\u0026nbsp; To address this democratic deficit, Alliance for Unity’s primary goal is to unite the traditional parties and encourage the standing of a single candidate in constituencies. If the SNP were to, say, have over 66% of the popular vote, then it would be difficult to deny that they had a mandate, but 50-50 doesn’t cut it. #2 - Define who is eligible to vote A Clarity Act would also stop any attempts to gerrymander the vote in the runup to an election. It’s disgrace that Scottish people on the UK electoral roll, but living in England or elsewhere, were not allowed to vote in the Scottish referendum, while non-citizens in Scotland were allowed a vote. How could non-Scots have had priority over Scots on a vote on issues of whether they want to give up their British identity and passports? The Act should start from the position that all Scots who are UK eligible to vote should be allowed to vote.\u0026nbsp; #3 - Define the wording There has been a huge amount of discussion on the advantages given to the Separatists use of YES in the Scottish Referendum, as a positive word for Separation. This was addressed in the Brexit referendum by using the words Leave and Remain. A similar discussion needs to take place about any potential future referendum. Consider the differences in the following questions: Would you like Scotland to be an independent country?Would you like Scotland to be an independent country that would then have to wait years to join the European Union?Would you like Scotland to leave the United Kingdom?Would you like Scotland to separate from the United Kingdom? Note: We are looking for funding to conduct a poll on the impact of using different questions. Please contact us if you would like to help fund it. #4- Require minimum turnout and voting thresholds It is extremely reckless to allow Separation based on 50%-plus-one-vote. It is a recipe for partition and civil disorder, simply because immediately 50%-minus-one people are unhappy about the result. For such huge constitutional issues a supermajority is absolutely necessary. I believe that 66%, which is a two-to-one majority is reasonable to avoid future conflicts. Similarly, a minimum turnout should be required. A simple calculation; If the vote is 66% but the turnout is only 50% this means that only 33% of voters voted for Separation — not enough. There is precedent: In the 1979 Scottish Devolution Referendum this for the proposal gained 51.6% of the votes, but were denied because that only represented 32.9% of the electorate. A 66% vote on an 75% turnout gives legitimacy, and future-proofs the legitimacy of the vote. This should not be an issue, as the previous referendum garnered 84.59% turnout. #5 - Safeguard regions The earlier issues of partition are dealt with, the better. Just as Separatists like to say that Scotland was dragged out of the EU against its will, how could they possibly defend regions, such as Dumfries and Galloway or Orkney and Shetland, that may vote against Separation, from claiming they are being ‘forced out of the UK against their will’. This means that minimum thresholds and turnouts must be applied on a region-by-region basis, and that any region that did not want to secede should have the right not to. In other words, the Separatists must make the case that the regions most against Separation will benefit most. They would need to address these regions\u0027 concerns: assure them that their aggressive centralisation will stop, and that border regions will not be unnecessarily burdened.\u0026nbsp; #6 - Require a confirmatory referendum It’s easy to sell a dream, but the reality of Separation can only be addressed through a confirmatory referendum. After winning the initial referendum, Separatists should have two years to\u0026nbsp;show the electorate their actual plans for day one of an independent Scotland. This might include real answers to these questions: How long will it actually take to get back into the EU?What terms can the country borrow on?What will happen to pensions?How will the country handle the deficit?Which taxes will be raised, which services will be cut?Who is the lender of last resort?Which currency will be used?What kind of border there will be? These of course should be provided now, but, as I said, it is easy to sell dreams.\u0026nbsp; Additionally, those two years would allow voters to see the effect of potential separation. Are investors knocking on the door, or has there — more likely — been capital flight? Of course, Separatists will not be able to account for currency fluctuations or world events after the second referendum, but at the very minimum, voters should have detailed answers for currency and borders. #7 - Demand a credible currency plan Separatists currently have the luxury of fudging which currency they are going to use. To be eligible to hold a referendum, it should be a condition that they must choose a credible currency plan. If Separatists cannot come up with a workable plan for currency then there should be no referendum at all.\u0026nbsp; Currently, voters are not sure if an \u0027independent\u0027 Scotland will use the pound, a new Scottish currency, or the Euro. There may be no good choice between these, but that’s political reality. It is not fair to voters to propose a referendum based on nebulous currency ideas that have not been thought out.\u0026nbsp;Separatists have to choose one and stick with it. #8 - Define how long a \u0027generation\u0027 is When Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond said the 2014 Referendum was once in a generation, we believed them. Both sides put in their best efforts , knowing that this was IT. The big one. The once-in-a lifetime opportunity.\u0026nbsp; To go back on that commitment is a national disgrace. Instead of healing the divisions caused by the referendum, Separatists continue to agitate for a second referendum, neglecting the day job, feeding false promises to their gullible supporters, and whipping up ever-more toxic anglophobia and ugly Nationalist sentiment. In a democracy, we often talk about Losers’ Consent, the idea that the losing side accepts the result of a vote. But we also must accept Winner\u0027s Prerogative: the winners, having won, get to set the terms.\u0026nbsp; We don’t rerun General Elections just because we don’t like the vote. We wait five years, while polls rise and fall. We sometimes win, we sometimes lose. But we always get up and fight again. --If another referendum does come round, in another actual generation, Separatists and voters will know what they have to do: fulfil the conditions of the Clarity Act. Without them, any claims to legitimacy are just that, claims.

They tend to be very dismissive of any new parties threatening to muscle in on the comfortable three-party opposition at Holyrood. They cling to the dream that their preferred leader, Douglas Ross or Richard Leonard, is going to lead the long-awaited recovery in the Conservative or Labour vote and sweep the Nationalists from power, or that Willie Rennie will become kingmaker in any coalition. All three parties and their cheerleaders are stuck in the pre-devolution politics, like households that have failed to change from analogue to digital. They are ignoring the Nationalist elephant in the room.\u0026nbsp; In May 2021, the legacy parties are once again set to split over 50% of the vote three ways, losing to the minority SNP by failing to embrace coalition BEFORE the election, despite polling by Scotland Matters and others that indicates the electorate is ready to ignore the old partisan approach to voting and cast their votes tactically, in support of an anti-separatist coalition. At the other end of the spectrum are smaller parties that view proportional representation (the list vote) as an opportunity to further their (usually single issue) ambitions.\u0026nbsp; The toxic nature of Scottish politics, coupled with disenchantment with main parties that have allowed extreme nationalism to fester, leads them to believe that there is a constituency of angry people out there who will give them their protest vote.\u0026nbsp; There are at least two parties with a manifesto commitment to abolish the Scottish Parliament as well as parties that are anti-lockdown or pro- or anti-Brexit and therefore, hoping to gain from unresolved issues with Europe or COVID. Even Nigel Farage has claimed he wants to enter the fray. However, in the hope of gaining exposure for their causes they all risk diluting the pro-Union vote. Some commentators have tried to lump Alliance for Unity in with these small parties. Party spin doctors have fed tame journalists false narratives that we are at best ‘unlikely to win many votes’ and at worst\u0026nbsp; ‘only likely to split the vote further.’\u0026nbsp; It would be a mistake to believe them. Alliance for Unity is a broad grassroots movement that transcends party politics. We seek to work with all other parties that reject separatism and will recommend voters to give their first votes to other parties and actively campaign for the Labour, Liberal or Tory candidates most likely to win in constituencies.\u0026nbsp; Our growing appeal is that we unite people from all political traditions in Scotland: one-nation Tories pragmatic enough to acknowledge that the defence of the Union is not safe in the hands of a Scottish Conservative Party that is only polling at around 20%; Labour voters who reject the fake socialism of the Nationalists, whose record on health and education has let down the poorest in society; Liberals appalled by an increasingly authoritarian SNP; Green voters who see through the far-left extremism of the Scottish Green Party.\u0026nbsp; We will encourage a plurality of views in the Parliament by running candidates with diverse political backgrounds on the lists, including some who wish to see Holyrood reformed or even abolished.\u0026nbsp; We are already building our coalition and have already received pledges of support\u0026nbsp; from smaller parties, such as the Scottish Unionist Party, the Workers’ Party and Laurence Fox’s Reclaim Party. Each of these parties understands that, in order to have any chance of promoting their own views in a coalition government, it is vital first to defeat the SNP and install a government of national unity.\u0026nbsp; The vote-splitting argument rests on the erroneous assumption that turnout is finite. The low turnout at recent Holyrood elections has allowed the SNP to form a government on a minority share of the vote. The Alliance for Unity, with our striker George Galloway spearheading the attack, can energise voters who feel alienated by the traditional parties and win votes that were not otherwise going to be cast.\u0026nbsp; May’s election truly will be the Battle for Britain – hence the Spitfire roundel symbol of the Alliance for Unity movement. A victory for the SNP and their thinly disguised ‘gardening section’, the Scottish Green Party, would be a disaster for Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Either they would bounce the government into a deeply damaging independence referendum while the economy is in recession, or they would continue the damaging ‘neverendum’ that holds Scotland’s economy back and stifles job creation, all while tightening their grip on Scotland’s institutions and media beyond the point of no return towards a one-party state.\u0026nbsp; We face a binary choice in May, between maintaining the Unity of the United Kingdom or facing the partition of Great Britain and of Scotland. We all need to accept that our own particular brand of politics needs to be subordinated to a greater cause for now. That is why all parties should put Scotland before party and work with the Alliance for Unity. Jamie Blackett is the Leader of the Alliance for Unity (@Alliance4Unity) .

After a few nail-biting days, we know our election results; the SNP has gained a seat, a single extra seat snuck in on the lists. It was stressful. I spent the two days glued to my computer, sweating and fretting for the future of our country. I groaned with pain at the loss of East Lothian and Ayr; I yelled with relief at Dumbarton so loud my wife thought I was dying, and I breathed a sigh of relief at Aberdeenshire West. Exhausted but relieved and determined to claim the head of whoever started the rumour that Jackie Baillie was 25 votes short in Dumbarton, as they have taken a fair few years off my heart. Nicola Sturgeon has come out fighting, demanding a second referendum and challenging those who oppose her to \"see her in court\", despite pro-union parties getting more votes than pro-secessionist ones. She started the fight the moment she knew the election was not a total disaster for her, even if she would not get a majority. But this attack is not against who you would expect, not against Boris Johnson, the Tories or the usual suspects, but rather a divisionary fight launched to ward off her attackers in the rapidly approaching civil war which threatens her political existence.\u0026nbsp; Alex Salmond handed Nicola Sturgeon a majority, and she lost it twice. She has failed to live up to her inherited precedent despite having the odds stacked very heavily in her favour. She had Boris, Brexit, the pandemic, the Tories, a cult of personality and all the good PR you could get. She had everything Alex Salmond did not have but yet failed to do what he did. With that precedent now missed, little public appetite for a vote anytime soon or any indication she would win that vote, she knows the vultures are closing in, and she is running out of time knowing the next five years will not be kind to the SNP or her.\u0026nbsp; She boldly tells the media that she will seek international pressure to force Boris\u0027s hand. That won\u0027t work because, as I have written about before, all other democratic countries won\u0027t want to encourage their separatist movements and the only allies she will find are enemies of the UK, people who treat their own separatists to bullets rather than ballots. But with each passing day, the factors that favour her pass and the odds stack up against her. For example, the soon to be released OECD report that was kept from us at the election. It will be very embarrassing when it lands and will likely claim a political scalp.\u0026nbsp; She is fighting a running battle. Those with her party that oppose her, those who have not been purged already, will seize upon the fact that she has failed to live up to their expectations by failing to deliver an SNP majority, and they shall start to look for her replacement as the bad press stacks up against her. Her opponents also know that you cannot play the \"opposition\" card after 14 or more years in power and that even SNP supporters are fed up with being marched up the hill one last time, as was noted in the run-up to this election where they were forced into holding their noses while they voted.\u0026nbsp; So what to expect? Expect Nicola Sturgeon to make a lot of noise but make no actual progress towards having her vote; expect her to talk about mandates and the constitution, as she started to before all the votes were even counted, and expect her to lose popularity. It may be challenging to remember a time before COVID, but in 2018 it seemed as if Nicola would be out of office before the election; COVID saved her. Still, it was only a stay of execution within the fickle and volatile nationalist camp. To those who question if she will ever be removed or if her popularity will ever decrease, I ask you to remember the fate of Winston Churchill after the end of the Second World War; people wanted to change then and will want it again. Despite kicking the absolute snot out of the Welsh nationalists and leading the Welsh Labour party to a resounding victory, Mark Drakeford knows this and plans to retire before too long, so too will Boris Johnson, and then the cries for revolution within the SNP will only grow stronger.\u0026nbsp; Nicola Sturgeon built this election around her getting a majority; she failed and will now pay the price of failure. So, as we embark on the next five years, and all that they may entail, keep up your spirits, because as things stand, Nicola Sturgeon is in far greater danger than the Union; Our battle to prevent an SNP majority is over, but her war of survival is just beginning.\u0026nbsp; Angus Robinson is a lecturer at a UK university.

Also, please sign our petition to get Newsquest and Gannet to cease publishing The National’s anti-English hate. THE LONGER VERSION It is difficult to believe that it’s been almost two months since the drama of the Scottish elections. We are proud to have had your support in fighting to deprive the Nationalists of the majority they so desperately needed.\u0026nbsp; When we started The Majority last year, ‘independence’ was polling at 58% and many people who were in established online media wrote us off as a bunch of amateurs using the wrong title.\u0026nbsp; We named ourselves ‘The Majority’ to represent the majority of anti-Nationalists frustrated by the lack of media pushback on years of Sturgeon’s minority government and also, to represent an ideal. Regardless of whether they want separation or unity, we believe that the majority of Scots want great schools and a great health service. The majority of us want a prosperous economy. The majority of us want to leave behind something better for the next generation of citizens. There is no reason why separation is needed to build a wealthy, happy, healthy, and dynamic future. We are stronger together than apart.\u0026nbsp; We now have over 35,000 social media followers, and have published many hard-hitting and insightful articles. With your support, we ran the highest profile media campaign of the election; Our #ResignSturgeon billboards were featured in 70 newspapers and the banner we flew over Holyrood and Glasgow was seen by hundreds of thousands of Scots. With your funds, we ran billboards, ad vans and poster campaigns all across Scotland. They worked. But while the prospect of a second referendum looks increasingly unlikely, we can be assured that fanatical Nationalists will never stop agitating and fomenting grievance in the hope of gaining one. There is much work still to do... Going forward, we anti-Nationalists mustn’t just debunk Nationalist myths, we must also expose and attack the underlying psychology that creates these myths. We must continue to expose and attack the greed, inferiority complexes and plain racism that fuels Scottish Nationalism. We must focus on our communal successes. And we must reach out to our youngest and most impressionable citizens, who are most easily swayed by empty promises cloaked in slick presentation. Over the next few months, we will be launching new campaigns to keep the pressure up. In addition to improving our editorial content, we are currently planning a Scottish news aggregator that will give you all\u0026nbsp; Scottish political news in one place.\u0026nbsp; We will also use our strength for direct social media activism, such as our newly-released petition to get Newsquest and Gannett to cease publication of The National, a front for Nationalist anti-English hatred and intimidation that should not be published, enabled or endorsed by any respectable corporation. Please sign the petition here. Planning new projects and running the Majority is more than a full-time job, so we still need your help.\u0026nbsp; It is understandable that after the election you may feel that there isn’t as much to fight for, but unlike our opposition politicians, we are fully committed to ‘putting the boot’ into the Nationalists; exposing, tainting and degrading their ugly Nationalism, so that no-one will ever want to be associated with it again. Every donation, big or small, makes a huge difference to us. If you can afford it, please pledge a monthly donation. Even £5 a month would be wonderful. But even if you can only afford a one-time donation, everything helps to give us a fighting base to continue our work and fund new projects. There’s a lot more to come.

Wilson has been given air space in the public prints recently, no doubt at the behest of Nicola Sturgeon, who gave his latest article, in the Spectator of 21 November 2020, a puff on Twitter, saying it was ‘on the case for independence – and the paucity of the case against – excellent and well worth a read’.\u0026nbsp; Wilson asserts that Scotland ‘cannot afford to remain on the UK’s glide path. Staying in the Union is riskier than independence. Voters can see that’. He also tells us that ‘Independence support is also emphatically not born of a chip on the shoulder towards England’. Believe that and you believe anything.\u0026nbsp; He dismisses the pro-Union position as ‘deficits, currency, borders: it all adds up to the same argument: “I wouldn’t start from here”’.\u0026nbsp; Well, where else is there to start from but here? ‘Here’ is Scotland mired, like everywhere else, in the Covid crisis. The UK Treasury has poured £10 billion into Scotland, plus Barnett consequentials, to support Scots during this crisis. From where would Scotland have found these funds had the ‘yes’ side won in 2014? Nationalists tell us loftily that Scotland would have done what the UK has done, and borrowed huge amounts of money to support the population. They do not explain how Scotland would have been able to borrow the kind of amounts that HM Treasury has poured into Scotland.\u0026nbsp; This money does come from borrowing. The UK borrows currently at very favourable interest rates, some of them negative so that lenders are paying it to borrow. The UK has favourable borrowing rates because it is the fourth most traded currency, the one that is also the fourth most held as a reserve currency in global reserves.\u0026nbsp; It is true that its exchange rate relative to the US dollar fell sharply after the Brexit vote in 2016, but it has stabilised at around $1.30 to the pound. I recall the rate falling to $1.10 in the early 1980s. Nationalists like to tell us that the UK is a basket case. The only basket to which it is related is the basket of five currencies used to calculate the value of IMF special drawing rates, of which the pound sterling is one. Had Scotland been on its own, it would, according to Andrew Wilson’s prescriptions, have been using the pound sterling. ‘Using’ means sterlingisation, similar to dollarisation where Ecuador and Panama use the US dollar informally.\u0026nbsp; Sterlingisation, which remains Wilson’s choice for the currency of a future separate Scotland for an indefinite period, means that Scotland would have no control over its monetary policy. It would have no lender of last resort – a term with which we became familiar during the banking crisis of 2008. Now, who would lend to a country without its own currency, with no control over its monetary policy and no lender of last resort to guarantee loans it might seek, and at what rates? If that country also repudiated a share of accumulated UK debt, which some Nationalists claim they would do, there would be little chance of a separated Scotland borrowing at all. For a country that lives well beyond its means, that would result in austerity of an order far beyond anything experienced by any of us.\u0026nbsp; Wilson’s ‘staying in the Union is riskier than independence’ is blown out of the water by this alone, quite apart from other considerations. And his attachment to sterlingisation would mean so-called ‘independent’ Scots having a currency whose notes would have ‘Bank of England’ printed on them because any Scottish banks that remained after Scexit would have no rights to issue sterling bank notes in the way that they currently do.\u0026nbsp; Mr Wilson does not explain in detail the relative ‘risks’ that are involved in being in a separate Scotland, but he makes a stab at inventing risks of Scotland remaining in the UK. He tells us that ‘the UK deficit this year, after Covid, will be more than twice what Scotland’s was last year... Yet Scots are asked to believe that their deficit starting point would be unfundable. Clearly this is not true’.\u0026nbsp; We are back to the question of HOW the deficits would be funded – the borrowing question that is dealt with above. Wilson sniffily dismisses the UK as the 21st richest country on earth in IMF rankings, rankings based on the dubious measure of GDP per capita. I seem to recall that, in 2014, Scotland was listed as likely to be about the 57th richest country.\u0026nbsp; Taking a humorous turn, Mr Wilson tells us that the ‘SNP prospectus is worked out and clear on currency, public finances…’. He is, of course, the author of the Growth Commission Report that was as welcome as a cup of cold sick at the SNP conference a couple of years ago.\u0026nbsp; Its prescriptions on currency and public finances were deeply unpopular with the SNP membership, some of whom noticed that he had smuggled into it a recipe for austerity. In the Spectator, he tells us ‘Rome wasn’t built in a day, but it was worth building’, and that Scots know that ‘it will take a huge effort. It will be hard work’. These are the last things SNP members and voters want to hear.\u0026nbsp; I’m afraid that Mr Wilson has done nothing to prove that Scotland would be better off on its own – outside both the UK and the EU. He writes glibly of a new central bank being created ‘immediately’ after Scexit, but gives not a hint of how he would find the funds to underwrite it, or of what its function would be while Scotland used sterling informally.\u0026nbsp;Andrew doesn\u0027t even know where to start on his road to nowhere. I know of no reputable economist who has hailed his prescriptions as viable. They are nothing more than attempt to square the circle of the SNP’s eternal problem: not having enough revenue to fund the lifestyle to which it has accustomed Scots.\u0026nbsp; Where are the funds coming from for the recent announcements that period products will be free, as will breakfasts and lunches for all primary pupils? Why, from Uncle Barnett at HM Treasury, of course.","date":"2020-12-01","summary":"If, as we are told, Andrew Wilson, ex-RBS PR man, is the SNP’s ‘leading economist’ and \u0027the Yes movement’s leading intellectual\u0027, the SNP is not in go..."},{"title":"Apples and Oranges","url":"/articles/apples-and-oranges/","content":"Imagine two salespeople at your door. One sells apples, the other oranges. Both fruits cost the same. The apple salesperson says, ‘Buy this apple, it’s tasty!’. The orange salesperson, worried at this simple message, tries a different approach, ‘You like apples? This orange is just like an apple’.\u0026nbsp; Which one are you most likely to choose? If the orange salesperson doesn’t believe in their product, why should we? There are many selling strategies, but dissing your own product never works. The customer says, \"I was actually thinking of buying an orange until told me it’s not as good as an apple, so I’ll just take that.\" Politics is sales. A politician\u0027s product is themselves, their party, and their policies. Not all of these are attractive all the time to all voters. It’s easy to sell popular policies; populists do it all the time. But, what’s popular isn\u0027t always what’s good.\u0026nbsp; Most people might think that it’s easy to sell popular products, and hard to sell unpopular ones, but all products have advantages and disadvantages. The best salespeople sell the benefits:\u0026nbsp; You’ll love this orange. It’s far better for you than an apple. Lots of Vitamin C. Good for COVID. Think how great you’ll feel after eating it! Which brings me to Douglas Ross’ performance yesterday... Just after I started the Majority, I was so appalled at Jackson Carlaw’s continuing praise for Nicola Sturgeon’s handling of the COVID epidemic that I wrote an article ‘Would you like a foot rub too Nicola?’ Perhaps it made a difference. Another straw to break the camel’s back. In any case, a few days later, Carlaw was gone, replaced by Ross. Just a few weeks before, Ross had shown some promise at Westminster, by questioning the SNP’s ‘power grab’ narrative, and his early statements showed a willingness to confront Nationalism.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/douglas4moray/status/1009052199865987074 But, Scottish Leavers were sceptical. Ever since the Brexit referendum they have been left out in the cold by the Scottish Tories. They saw a glimmer of hope when the UK party realigned, but the Scottish party, and Ross, remained Remainers. Ruth Davidson is often praised, but she is responsible for much of today’s Nationalist narrative. She foolishly backed Remain, knowing it put her on the side of the SNP. Yet, despite no Scottish party leader advocating for Leave, over one million Scots still voted to Leave the EU. Just think what that number would have been if someone had been arguing for Leave. Every time you hear the SNP say ‘Scotland voted to stay in Europe’ you should think ‘Thanks Ruth!’ In the years since the Brexit referendum, she never reached out to Leavers. She fought against Boris Johnson’s nomination, as did Jackson Carlaw. And that led to the demonisation of Boris in Scotland (more on this in a moment). Now, after years of struggle to implement the largest democratic vote in the UK, and Brexit almost done, Ross, in a speech to the Policy Exchange, said: Brexit has been damaging to support for the UK because it undermined, in the eyes of many, those common values shared across our nations. https://twitter.com/ScotTories/status/1323217438062878720 Leaving to the side that we are one nation, why is Ross saying this? Surely, at this late stage, instead of talking Brexit down, he should be touting the potential benefits of Brexit to Scots? By siding with those who think Brexit is damaging, Ross has further alienated all of those Leave voters who were already frozen out. One million potential Scottish voters, just left there, with no support. Demonised. Condescended to. Subverted. Ignored. You’d think he\u0027d be smarter: By promising to deliver Brexit, Boris Johnson delivered an 80 seat Tory majority. In the same speech, Ross supported ‘a more flexible immigration system with a \"greater role\" for the Scottish Government’. An SNP policy. Then it got worse, as if that was even possible. An ITV news interview was released in which Ross praised Nicola Sturgeon’s communication skills: I think most objective people would say is a more effective communicator than the Prime Minister. And, when asked if Boris Johnson was harmful to the case for Scotland staying in the UK, said: We can’t say that the people of Scotland are absolutely wrong with their ratings on their various leaders, so we’ve got to reflect on that, and the Prime Minister reflects on it. https://twitter.com/PeterAdamSmith/status/1323305526466383874 Carlaw got binned for less than this. Nationalists have demonised Boris from the beginning. Yet few Scottish Tories have ever stood up for him. Now that lack of support is coming back to haunt them.\u0026nbsp; On Twitter someone said to me, ‘Ross is right because Boris Johnson is a terrible PM. The sooner he is gone, the quicker we can get on with defeating the Nationalists.’ But Nationalists will just demonise the next leader. It’s what they do. You think Sunak is safe? Not a chance. They demonise Conservatives. They demonise Labour. They demonise Brexit. The demonise the UK. They demonise Boris. They\u0027ll demonise the next PM and will continue to demonise everything they are against.\u0026nbsp; They demonise Conservatives. They demonise Labour. They demonise Brexit. The demonise the UK. They demonise Boris. They\u0027ll demonise the next PM and will continue to demonise everything they are against.\u0026nbsp; So why would anyone think agreeing with them will work?\u0026nbsp; Then there was an afternoon of Kabuki, where Ross was positioned as some kind of saviour, fighting for us poor Scots against Westminster for furlough cash. Just like the SNP. Whoever thought up this strategy should be fired. I’ve been told that this is to reach some group of so-called ‘indy curious’ voters: would-be Tory voters who have been seduced by Nicola Sturgeon’s handling of the COVID crisis.

It’s not as though we can’t see how this strategy will play out. Scottish Labour lost all of their voters by trying to be like, and be liked, by the SNP.

But sometimes even good people can find themselves doing bad things for bad reasons. Sometimes they can even be its cheerleaders. Until they start to question... I\u0027m sure the many people who have switched from Labour to Scottish Nationalism think of themselves as good people. But, like Mitchell’s unquiet Nazi, they’re beginning to find themselves on the wrong side of the story. Today Neil Mackay, published an editorial in The Herald: Scottish independence: You really don’t have to be a nationalist to back it. It should have been titled: A vain attempt to have your cake and eat it. First, Mackay tries to tell us he’s not a Nationalist (honest!): I’m not a nationalist, however. You don’t need to be a nationalist – or an SNP supporter for that matter – to favour independence. I’m not alone – there are many like me, I assure you. I’m not sure who he’s trying to reassure here, but in any case, it’s a logical fallacy. What’s popular isn\u0027t always what’s right. But, let\u0027s see the evidence: When it comes to politics, I’m avowedly anti-nationalist. I’m an old-fashioned internationalist. I distrust nationalism of all stripes. I’m a liberal-leftie who sees everyone as pretty much the same – so I’ve no time for the exceptionalism that nationalism offers. Just because I was born on one bit of land and you on another, it doesn’t make us different. I think I’ll repeat that bit: Just because I was born on one bit of land and you on another, it doesn’t make us different. So who did this avowed anti-Nationalist internationalist distrustful-of-Nationalists liberal-leftie vote for? Have I voted SNP in the past? Yes. Do I always vote SNP? Definitely not. Will I vote SNP in the future? It’s highly unlikely. My voting history mirrors that of many readers, I guess. I was a Labour voter. Labour became uninhabitable after the Iraq War. I came to find the SNP an acceptable home for my vote towards the end of the 2000s. In other words, he used a narrow policy point to reject the whole idea of socialism and turned to brutish Nationalism. But, with a failed referendum behind him and his dreams not working out, he’s started to notice the skulls on the caps: Firstly, many prominent SNP voices embrace the nationalism I hate – flag-wrapped, bullying, exceptionalist.\u0026nbsp; You enabled it, mate, by voting for them. And this somewhat begs the question: what is the nationalism you do like? They cuddle up to extremists online. The tragedy is, I know plenty of really good people in the SNP, some of whom hold high office, but they’re silent. Why are they silent? Is it because if they speak out they’ll get shouted down by their extremist Nationalist compatriots? Secondly, I find the SNP in government to be severely lacking. Heath and education are simply not good enough in this country. The SNP, as it often does, talks a good game when it comes to climate change – the most important political concern facing this country – but there’s not enough action. The party has also proposed deeply illiberal policies – like the Hate Crime Bill, and its flirtation with suspending jury trials amid pandemic. Shock! Man discovers the party he votes for is crap at any other policy except agitating for Separatism. Calling Robin McAlpine. Thirdly – and worst of all – is the attitude of the party. It’s become sneering of anyone with the temerity to question its authority – as seen from the behaviour towards the press during coronavirus. The SNP from top to bottom confuses questions with attack – mirroring many in the Yes movement. This smacks of fragility, and fragility implies someone isn’t confident in their own position. Nationalists are authoritarian control freaks? Who would’ve thunk it? The party is tearing itself to bits in a flurry of civil wars between the Sturgeon and Salmond wings, over ‘woke’ policies, over Plan Bs. The current Salmond inquiry leaves any decent spectator with one overriding opinion: a plague on both your houses. The party has become secretive, complacent, entitled.\u0026nbsp; Nationalists are secretive and controlling? Really? It’s also now a vehicle for mediocre careerists who please the hierarchy. Kiss the right ass and you’re in with the bricks, seems to be the current rule of thumb. Amazing insight. Next you’ll be asking if the Pope is a catholic. So as I said, you don’t need to be a nationalist or an SNP supporter to back independence. Wait a minute. So, after all that you’re still going to vote for ‘independence’? But Neil, what is the vehicle for ‘independence\u0027 if it’s not the SNP? Where is this magical non-Nationalist party that will deliver your dreams? The point Mackay, Gerry Hassan, Robin McAlpine, and other so-called socialist commentators seem to be blind to is that when they view politics through the eyes of a nation that is, by definition, Nationalism. Simply claiming not to be a Nationalist when everything they do and write supports Nationalism isn’t going to wash any more. https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1307371489646256128 Despite their claims, they\u0027re no socialists. They voted for and supported ALL OF THE ABOVE, because they selfishly value the idea of a nation more than reality of our health, education, economy, and the poor. They enabled centralisation, intolerance to questioning and party secrecy. They enabled racist nutters at the border. If they were socialists, they would have rejected all these things. Socialism is about pooling and sharing of resources, internationalism and equality. Nationalism is about none of those things. It’s an ideology based on selfishness and greed. They can’t have it both ways. It\u0027s not possible to be both a Nationalist and a Socialist (and if you are for both, we all know where ‘National Socialism’ ends up).\u0026nbsp;You either own it completely, or you disavow it completely. And one more thing, just like the Nationalism you say you supported for noble reasons, hand wringing now isn’t noble. It doesn’t absolve you of your actions. It’s a feeble attempt to garner credit for having your cake and eating it.\u0026nbsp; Neil and his compatriots shouldn’t be posing as a tormented souls, while still supporting the ideology that caused the problem. They should be apologizing for the harm they have caused and making amends. Yes Neil, you are the baddy.

Every day, I see people arguing on Twitter, trying to counter Nationalist arguments. One thread I\u0027ve been following on Twitter has literally hundreds of responses trying to convince Nationalists that they are wrong about Scotland’s finances. Of course the Nationalists are wrong.\u0026nbsp; But has all that discussion done any good? No. Has anyone been converted? No. Has it taken the fight back to them? Rarely. Has a lot of time been wasted. Yes. So, I’m going to tell you a (bad) joke: How does a fool keep themself busy? By saying that Scotland financially supports England. How do two fools keep themselves busy? By replying that that’s not true. One of the main aims of The Majority is to disarm Nationalist slurs and help anti-Nationalists craft better strategies to help fight back against Nationalism. So let’s get a few things straight: This battle is not about facts or figures but ideology. When Nationalists say that Scotland supports England, that Scotland pays for HS2, that England steals whisky tax, and a litany of other bogus, idiotic, and fraudulent claims, there is little use trying to beat them with \u0027balance, nuance and informed reason\u0027. They simply move the goalposts and get us running around trying to find fact after fact. We can\u0027t fight back if we\u0027re too busy answering questions. This is not a library. This is a battle.\u0026nbsp; An ideological battle and our weapons are psychology and language. It drives me mad to see people being so defensive. The objective is not to counter our opponents with facts. It\u0027s not about telling them they are factually wrong. It\u0027s about showing them that they are ideologically wrong.\u0026nbsp; The ideas they have at a core level are, frankly, disgusting. They have divided, slurred and insulted us to gain political power. Our country is riven with bigotry they’ve created. And they need to be called out. The objective is not to be patient and kind, but to expose their toxic ideology and make them ashamed to even bring it up. We all know the expression: never wrestle with a pig because both of you will end up covered in shit, but the pig will enjoy it. Right now the Nationalists are getting us on the ground, rolling us\u0026nbsp;in their endless crap and laughing at us.\u0026nbsp; We need to be the pigs. Get them on the ground and give them a taste of their own filth. BE THE PIG. Stop thinking facts alone will work. The basic response to any Nationalist should be to force them to defend their toxic ideology: Why are you a Nationalist, one of the ugliest ideologies known to man? Highlight who gains: Why do you support people who divide us to seek power? And link their statements to Nationalist traits: Blaming outsiders? Yup, that\u0027s what Nationalists do. Why do you go along with that? All of these, and the many variations that we can come up with together, achieve many things: Give something a label and it sticks. When we call Nationalism toxic and ugly, it sticks in the mind of anyone reading the thread. Maybe they don’t know much about Nationalism, but now they know that many people think it’s ugly. And they’ll try to avoid it.Questions demand a response. We’ve been answering their questions so patiently. Let them do the work for a change.They are forced to defend their Nationalism, which means they have to either admit to being a Nationalist, in which case you can simply tie them to toxic ideology and beat them with it. Or they run away. At the very least, we get the people reading the thread reading that Nationalism is toxic. Nationalists have been doing this to us for years. They called us \u0027Unionists\u0027 to divide us (you don\u0027t have to be a \u0027Unionist\u0027 to be against Nationalism) and make us defend the flaws of the Union, instead of their flaws. They call us \u0027BritNats\u0027 to falsely project their own toxic Nationalism on to us, even though they\u0027re actual Nationalists. They called Labour supporters “Red Tories” so much that, rather than be associated with the Tories, many socialists became Nationalists, a toxic ideology that socialists have fought against since time immemorial.\u0026nbsp; That’s the power of words.\u0026nbsp; And while we’re busy defending those slurs, they’re avoiding scrutiny. But when we unite as anti-Nationalists, that can’t be thrown back at us. And when we expose them as Nationalists they cant defend their ugly ideology. And one final thing: let’s put an end to their smug self-righteousness. Nationalism is not noble, it’s not civic. It’s absolutely not international (the clue is in the name). It’s a despicable ideology that feeds on division. Us, and Them. Patick Harvie, leader of The Scottish Greens, is just one of many hypocrites who hide their support for anti-English racism behind the cloak of ‘social justice’. He preaches tolerance and rights for black, gay, and transgender people (which is, of course, an important and worthy goal) while gaining power by supporting Nationalists who practice epic bigotry against the English. We need to call this hypocrisy out, consistently and strongly. We’re better than “down South” is the definition of ugly Nationalism. We will never win this fight if we don\u0027t stop being so defensive. We need to start fighting back. Pick a target and throw their smug, ugly Nationalism back at them. Let’s fight smart, make Nationalism a dirty word in Scotland, and win. Be The Pig. THE ANTI-NATIONALIST CHEAT SHEET These are starting points: they can always be improved. Please come to our forum and work with us to create and refine the best responses. DEFUSE THEIR SLURSWhen they call you a Unionist: \u0027I\u0027m not a Unionist, Red Tory or BritNat.

The short answer: it will be unchanged from Obama in 2014 and all modern US presidents.\u0026nbsp; Firstly, as Biden has said in his speeches since becoming president-elect, his tenure of the Whitehouse will be marked by unifying, not dividing, an already polarised nation. He has said he will appeal to the millions who voted for his competitor and strive to embody the words of the then-senator, and later president, of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, who said on the eve of the American civil war, “A house divided against itself cannot stand”. Biden will also have to deal with secessionists movements in his own country, such as the Texas Nationalist Party, Greater Idaho, Yes California and a myriad of other small groups who, in this day and age, are as polarised as ever, and often more armed than ever.\u0026nbsp; Americans remember the Civil War; it has left an indelible scar on their Union and the national collective consciousness as the bloodiest war in American history. Despite the slogan change, the duty of the president is to act in the best interests of the nation, and in this case, that is taking a strong stance against secession. From the Civil War to the present day, the United States has made it very clear that secession will not be tolerated, and it has deemed it \"unconstitutional\" - American legal jargon for never. President Biden, regardless of his heritage and supposed political sympathies, cannot support such groups domestically, and therefore, will not support such movements internationally either, as it will be taken as either hypocrisy or tacit support.\u0026nbsp; But, let us look closer to home for examples of how secessionist movements are isolated. The European Union did not rally to Catalonia, lest Italy have to face Lombard secession or France and Corsica, or Belgium and Flanders, Germany and Bavaria, the Czech Republic and Moravia, Moldova and Transnistria, and so on.\u0026nbsp; For centuries, Europe has been torn apart by nationalism, and the blood of millions of its citizens has been shed because of it. The European Union is meant to bring European countries closer together, not to divide them further.\u0026nbsp; Regardless of the outcome of Brexit, the European Union will not suddenly support Scottish secession; we already know the legal advice used in 2014 was a lie. It will not do so for the simple fact that to support it externally is to support it tacitly internally.\u0026nbsp; In the face of an uncertain future, no country and no leader would advocate such a dangerous and damaging position - that is, except one.\u0026nbsp; The Russian Federation is a keen supporter of secessionist movements, though never openly, as it does not want to encourage the numerous secessionist groups within the federation. Though, as seen in the many small post-Soviet wars, the standard Kremlin answer is not to offer a ballot but, rather a bullet.\u0026nbsp; The Russian government supports these movements because it is part of its long-standing hybrid war doctrine -- to sow discord and to internally strive to weaken its enemies and openly question their internal democratic processes, and always as an exercise in whataboutery to distract its own population from their myriad internal problems.\u0026nbsp; However, Timeo Danaos et Dona Ferentes, ‘be wary of Greeks bearing gifts’. The Kremlin does not care at all about the state of Scotland\u0027s future, in fact, the worse, the better for them. It doesn\u0027t care for democracy, or poverty, for a green future or for social equality or anything the nationalists say Scottish secession stands for.\u0026nbsp; What Russia stands for is a weaker UK, a weaker Europe, a weaker NATO and weaker West. To achieve this, it spreads the seeds of distrust online and throughout the national consciousness. Indeed, it now employs the movement’s former leader. Nationalists love to say how somehow, they have been thrown under the bus; the Kremlin couldn\u0027t care less if it was under a tank.\u0026nbsp; Europe did not support Catalonia and America fought its bloodiest war against those who attempted to break up its Union. The Russians are not your friends. So, secessionists, know this: you are alone.\u0026nbsp;","date":"2020-11-11","summary":"I want to be a part of an America that continues to stand up for all of us, not bail on all our friends across the country.Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric ..."},{"title":"Bigger.

It becomes so overwhelming that individuals inside the ideology cannot see beyond it. This self-fulfilling and circular belief operates as a set of paradoxes. The Soviet totalitarian system was both eternal and dying, full of vigour and structurally flawed,\u0026nbsp; dedicated to high ideals yet operating in a manner devoid of them. Understand this paradox, and you will understand nationalism and the nationalist, how supposedly rational people believe in false-equivalence, establish and maintain their echo chambers, ignore facts in favour of opinion and reduce all to “us” and \"them\".\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; When times are hard, and no clear path to recovery is visible, it becomes all too easy\u0026nbsp; to blame the \"other\". Nationalism is the cowardly and simplistic choice for those who seek to\u0026nbsp; deny their responsibility for the situation they find themselves in. It is always someone else\u0027s fault. Your town is visited by the plague, burn the nearby ghetto. Your country is struggling, blame the immigrants. Your team is not successful, blame the opposition. You lost the war, blame a \"traitor\", or better still create one.\u0026nbsp; Nationalism channels and personifies all that is wrong into a single entity combining all that frustrates, frightens and constrains. Yet, in doing so, the Nationalist creates a figment of their imagination. They have both made and drank their own snake oil, poisoning themselves in the quest for a cure to an illness that never even existed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; I have devoted my professional career to the study of warfare and the reasons why people fight. I have watched the nationalist movement grow, yet never sophisticate, and now I see\u0026nbsp; it degenerate. I now see the same hate, insecurities and blame that I have experienced to horrifying ends across the world, from the vast prairies of the American heartland to the dusty cities of Afghanistan. I ask you, how many of you have seen the remains of a man power-hosed off a wall after an explosion ripped the atoms of his existence apart all in the name of constructed divisions? If this narrative and anger continues, you may well see it, and I can promise you, that you will never forget the sight, the sound and above all the smell. Scottish Nationalism is not different; it is not civic; it is not noble; it is born of the same hate which has claimed countless lives. I am at a loss to understand how a nation with such recent and visceral experience of internecine war in Northern Ireland could ever believe that the solution lies in replicating it. But then, I have not swallowed the snake oil.\u0026nbsp; The pendulum of opinion for Scottish ‘independence’ is inexorably tied to the\u0026nbsp; performance of the economy, and ultimately the state and attitude of society. When things are\u0026nbsp; going well the desire to separate is low. Things aren\u0027t going well now and many people feel powerless, so they feel the need to blame and rage against something simple. They desire to separate regardless of the extent of damage that it would cause. The French would call this a crime of\u0026nbsp; passion.\u0026nbsp; In reality, to face the world as we find it today with all its problems and all its\u0026nbsp; possibilities, many of which make the constitutional debate pale into insignificance, we must shoulder responsibility; we must build bridges even when we want to burn them. We must reach out to those who have swallowed their own snake oil, and let them know the reality of\u0026nbsp; the facts they have rejected. Despite the rank division of the last decade, recent polling continues to show that 60% of people believe that the populations of the UK have more in common than their differences. That alone should settle this verbal civil war and give us hope for the future. For over 300 years, we have been unified, and we have prospered. Together we are greater than the sum of our parts.

In its place are 129 Homer Simpsons clinging to a donut. What Scotland needs more than anything, from COVID19 to unfinished hospitals to rusting ferries to fiscal blackholes is a turnaround team. My background is in medicine and surgery but also in health economics and management. One of the biggest challenges for health managers is turning around a failing hospital, or several hospitals, or even a whole organisation. To turn around the failure we need to identify that the Scottish Parliament, not only the Scottish Government, is failing. That failure needs audited from top to bottom and skilled professionals brought in to both run the government and strip out the waste and the harm in Holyrood\u0027s culture. That needs experienced minds, clean hands of devolved politics, and the will and means to sack the board. The fish rots from the head down and Sturgeon\u0027s government is stinking.\u0026nbsp;With everything I have seen, every model and piece of data I have asked myself how can we show Scotland that we are the answer? I think the answer is we are us and not the establishment. This year has convinced me of this more than ever.

Setting up and running our podcast was a lot of work. Now that’s more settled, I hope to get more articles out regularly. Thank you for your patience. — The SNP pensions brouhaha rumbles on, with the reality-based community trying vainly to impress upon delusional nationalists that they are living in a fantasy world. A ‘fact check’ in The National newspaper presented two options: the UK will continue to pay Scots pensions because 1) the UK currently pays the pensions of UK citizens who live overseas 2) If you claim dual citizenship i.e. remain a UK citizen, you can still be paid. On Twitter, I noted that the first of these options is false; after separation, recipients would not be UK citizens. And the second? Well, it’s a strange ‘independence’ that leaves its citizens sucking on the teat of the UK for continued sustenance. rUk taxpayers would take a dim view of dual citizens collecting both UK and Scots pensions. As always, it seems the nationalists want to have their UK cake and eat it too. Along the way, I read Alex Massie’s pension article and\u0026nbsp;was astounded by the first sentence in this paragraph. Independence is a respectable cause now debased by its promoters’ untruths. Extraordinarily, the SNP position on pensions is more fantastical than that offered to the Scottish people in 2014. The party’s independence prospectus was deluded in many ways but at least it accepted that the state pension would have to be funded in Scotland, by Scottish taxpayers. Independence is a respectable cause? As Brexit fades, Massie’s columns have tended to be more pro-UK, but there’s always that underlying current of ‘If only…’.\u0026nbsp; In July last year he wrote that Sturgeon\u0027s SNP had been engaged in ‘good governance’, that\u0026nbsp;the pandemic \u0027has seen her at her finest\u0027, and most tellingly of all, \u0027A better nationalism would be larger than this\u0027. What is this ‘better nationalism\u0027? These sentiments are mirrored by The Times Separatist-in-Chief, Kenny Farquharson, who, after writing a whole article about how Scottish nationalism is founded on ‘othering’ of the English, says that he would \u0027love to be proved wrong\u0027 about it. Shot: The English must be othered. It is as simple and as brutal as that. Because that is how we justify cutting ourselves off from them. We are not like them. They are weak in ways we are strong. Their morals are different to ours. We are better off without them. In parallel, talk of “the Scottish people” must be celebratory and vague. The impression must be fostered that there is one Scotland when in fact there are many Scotlands.\u0026nbsp;Chaser: And here in Scotland I have another hope. I wonder if Scottish nationalism can pursue independence from England without taking the low road of othering the English. Can it be done? Is there a high road? Can the Yes movement avoid this moral peril?\u0026nbsp; I suspect not, but I would love to be proved wrong. Why would he love to be proved wrong? Surely, the past 14 years (and any reading of history or even common sense) would have made it plain that there is no better Scottish Nationalism than this. THIS IS IT. It won\u0027t get better, because there is no \u0027better\u0027. Nationalism is always an economic, cultural and intellectual dead end. It’s a political cancer. Even when it\u0027s dressed in one of Sturgeon\u0027s smart suits. Despite seeing the mendacity of those who promote nationalism, and its toxic effect on our institutions, culture and livelihood; the lies; the othering; the casual incomptence; the economic insanity; despite the people of Scotland rejecting separatist dreams decisively, these Times appeasers still think the underlying goal of breaking up the UK -- for that is what ‘independence’ really is —\u0026nbsp; is \u0027respectable\u0027. But what part of breaking up the UK, impoverishing Scots, tearing apart communities, erecting a hard border, weakening our defences and putting delusional, incompetent, authoritarian nationalists in permanent power is \u0027respectable\u0027? I’d really like to know. Why would anyone look around at the disaster that is nationalist Scotland and say, ‘But I want to be proved wrong?’ The answer is that they don\u0027t see it, because despite everything, these appeasers want nationalism to work. If Scottish nationalists were economically competent (they’re not) or not full of anti-English grievances (they are), it’s clear that these journalists would sell the rest of us out. Driven by the idea that the break up of the UK is a \u0027respectable cause\u0027, they constantly give a minority of Scottish nationalists the benefit of every doubt, something they would never, ever give to English nationalists, never give to Brexiteers, and never give to Tories. While the first are rightly ignored, the latter three must always be castigated, brought down and humiliated at every opportunity. But never Scottish nationalists. Then when they look at the wreckage they’ve promoted, just like communists who claim their failed ideology hasn’t been done right, they sit on society\u0027s ashes and self-righteously shout \u0027Fools! Real Scottish nationalism hasn\u0027t been tried yet!\u0027 Note what they never say: There is no path to a second referendum; Nationalism is toxic; Breaking up the UK is a disastrous idea. Instead, every nationalist idea, no matter how shit, must be indulged. Beards must be scratched. After all, it\u0027s a \u0027respectable cause\u0027. But we ordinary people clearly see the damage their appeasement has caused. We will remember that when they could have stood up for unity and reality, they continued to support a failed, tiresome and immature dream. On Twitter, Massie responded to us calling him out with, ‘Always good to be reminded there are lunatics on all sides’, which is quite a slur on anyone who takes his highly-paid words literally. You said it mate, not us. Words matter. Meanwhile, Farquharson and his pal David Leask try to slur us as extremists. Keeping the UK together is not an extreme position. It is the settled will of the Scottish people and the position held by the vast majority of UK citizens. The Times Appeasement Division, fronted by Massie and Farquharson, with footsoldiers Leask, Fiona Rintoul and Kevin Pringle are the real extremists, for continuing to indulge a nationalist fantasy well past its sell-by date.\u0026nbsp; 14 years of failed policies and a neverendum that they continue to promote, proves them wrong. There is no ‘better nationalism’. Breaking up the UK is not a ‘respectable cause’.\u0026nbsp; It’s time The Times stopped indulging their journalists\u0027 immature separatist fantasies and grew up. BONUS QUIZ: How many appeasements can you find in this single Kenny Farquharson paragraph? In an article a few days ao, Farquharson implored Dorothy Bain, the Lord Advocate to break the constitutional ‘stalemate’. In a single paragraph, I counted EIGHT appeasements. See if you can catch them all... Independence is one of the defining political issues of the age, a question of national self-determination and the competing democratic mandates of Westminster and Holyrood. Any sensible observer would conclude the stalemate was crying out for a political solution, with all sides coming together to negotiate a codified, legislative route to a referendum.

Facial recognition soon identified him as a Mr Rip Van McWinkle, ‘innocently’ ordering a well-deserved drink at the Glen Laggard Inn. “Scots pounds,” the landlady explained.\u0026nbsp; Rip was too busy grumbling to listen – “rassinfrassin-poundzapint” – as he fished through his coins one by methodical one. “Ooh, that’ll do nicely,” the woman chirruped, snatching a handful. McWinkle’s face blanked. “It’s only five quid,” he said – but she just gave him a wee wink. “Been living under a stone, have ye?” Rip took a glug. His tongue was dry as leather. In fact, that afternoon he’d dozed off for a teeny bit longer than usual – somehow his watch seemed to have stopped completely – and now he was in urgent need of some liquid refreshment.\u0026nbsp; “New round here, are ye?” asked the wiry-looking gentleman as he sat down. It was an odd question.

Rip was less distracted by the flash of grenades than the spurts of pepper spray clouding the air with acid. He ducked under the table, but it was too late. The raid was over in minutes. Inspector Rankin was pleased with the press coverage. “Our battle against the currency smugglers is relentless – and we’re winning.” Best of all, it would please the Chief, especially if they could break that dozy old mule and get to ringleaders.

In a milestone for Scotland’s post-Independence industrial policy, ministers raised a dram yesterday as DC Thomson was finally brought under public ownership.\u0026nbsp; The takeover was agreed after a Nationalist boycott of the traditionally Unionist company led directors to raise the white flag earlier in the year. “We used Bash Street Kids tactics against them … heh-heh-heh,” admitted a Culture Ministry official on condition of anonymity. The longstanding publisher of The Beano, The Dandy, The Broons and other traditional family favourites aims to take on mighty rivals like Disney, Marvel and DreamWorks with the creation of DCT, a cutting-edge Scottish champion in the superhero stakes. “Desperate Dan needs to step up to the big league,” a Scottish government strategist explained. The Company’s new CEO, Sir Murrell Sturgeon (no relation), has insisted its portfolio of well-loved characters will be shielded from any editorial interference, though keen-eyed Westminster correspondents have noted Dennis the Menace now sports an unruly blond mop – while Gnasher, his canine sidekick, has a more contemporary vibe, complete with hoodie and shaved head.\u0026nbsp; Looks familiar? “You might very well think that,” a DCT spokesperson conceded, “but I couldn’t possibly comment.” The Broons, of course, will remain The Broons, but with a new character, Uncle Gordon, added to the usual family frolics. “He’s a great laugh. A typical old grump, living in the past, worrying himself silly about pensions. Phwah … what a loser!” Some subtle changes are planned, however. Under the new green policy guidelines, The Bash Street Kids will be gobbling up double helpings of baked beans before converting their teacher’s hand-cranked charabanc to freshly farted bio-gas. Desperate Dan, meanwhile, will no longer be stuffing himself with cow pie. “A vegan vol-au-vent is just as scrummy!” explained DCT’s Thought Leadership Team.\u0026nbsp; The most controversial change will be with Minnie the Minx, now transitioning to Mannie the Minx, the first openly transsexual cartoon character. “Flexy is the new sexy,” enthused Dudley Auchterloonie, Professor of Self-Identity, in a review of editorial policy.\u0026nbsp; Less sexy – and rather more pesky – is an increasing number of bi-national self-identifiers coming out among Scotland’s border and island communities. The government is urging DCT to play its part in holding the line against GB+ groups after commissioning its artists to work on a new patriotic animation superheroes.

The mood is changing, and nasty bigotry is becoming more mainstream. I love it here, but recently, based purely on the way I sound, I have felt judged and not welcome in the country I call home. And it breaks my heart.\u0026nbsp; I have lived in Scotland for four years, and before that I worked here for a few months of the year for four years. I represent a mix of nations that is modern Britain. My family history and name are Welsh and I represented Wales at rugby when I was 17.\u0026nbsp; But I grew up in England, and was lucky enough to get a scholarship and bursary to go to a private school. So I have what some people think is a “posh” English accent. Recently, whilst picking up some food in an Edinburgh Supermarket I was told “to fuck off and go be English somewhere else”. All for the crime of getting in the way of a bigot who wanted to walk past me in the socially-distanced one-way aisle.\u0026nbsp; One of my SNP supporting Scottish friends, who was standing next to me at the time did nothing to call the xenophobe out, and later tried to say the incident didn’t happen, claiming he heard something different. So much for solidarity and for challenging hate speech, something that wasn’t lost in his subsequent support for the BLM movement. Square that circle. Was he embarrassed? Was he in denial being on the “same side” as that hate? Does he actually agree with it? I’ll never know. His silence at the time speaks for itself. He is part of the problem regardless, there is no doubt in my mind. If someone can hear the sound of my voice and tell me to “go be English somewhere else” then what other assumptions and leaps can that man make about other strangers’ skin colours, genders or sexualities. If you judge others and label them based on the sound of their voice, then surely you’ll judge everyone that doesn’t look like you too. You might say this is just one anecdotal example, but I have many more. Just as insidious, at a friend’s party on New Year’s Eve I was accused of being a “Posh Tory-supporting, Boris Johnson wannabe, English twat”. Granted, I have blonde hair and sound vaguely like Johnson. However, I am a member of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. On this occasion, the perpetrator was called out and I received an apology. But, for this educated and drunk (not that those matter), acquaintance at this party, to make THAT abusive, xenophobic, down right wrong leap is not just scary but straight-up nasty Nationalism.\u0026nbsp; The vile perfect storm of hate breeding in Scotland is catalysed and stoked by mean, insecure, chips-on-shoulders, inferiority complex Scottish Nationalists, who somehow feel threatened by “English” people. Are the Scots really persecuted by the English? I certainly am not interested in persecuting anyone, and I believe the vast majority of English people aren’t. Most English and British people have a very positive view of Scotland. So why is it that Nationalists think that everything that is right in Scotland is a result of the SNP and everything that is wrong in Scotland is caused by the English and the Tories? The SNP has been in power in Scotland for 13 years, isn’t it time they took some responsibility and stopped blaming outsiders for their woes? Isn’t it also time the silent majority of Scots call this Caledonian xenophobia, or as I call it, Calexenophobia, out and act in solidarity with their British family members?\u0026nbsp; If Scotland is to become a progressive, social democracy like the SNP keep saying it is, then why don’t we all start to be an ally to the victims of the hate and be aware of the institutionalised state-sanctioned hate that has reared its ugly head in Scotland.\u0026nbsp; I’m not a Unionist, I’m anti-xenophobic, anti-racist and anti-Nationalist.

It enables me to see now that one man has been responsible for the dire state that Scotland is in. His name is David Cameron. As British Prime Minister, he played a strong hand as if he were on the defensive, and has consigned us to Neverendumland. He did much the same over Brexit, but that’s another story. Cameron took the SNP’s electoral win in 2011 at face value and did not consider its detail and ramifications. Indeed, the SNP won a majority of seats, a result which the – now widely disparaged – D’Hondt system had lumbered us with. But this ‘landslide victory’, as Alex Salmond the showman characterised it, was less than it seemed. It amounted to a win of 45 per cent of the votes on a turnout of 50 per cent. That is, 22.5 per cent of those entitled to vote supported the SNP. Further, only a mere half of eligible Scottish voters could be bothered to turn out to vote in an election for their own parliament, about whose creation there had been so much song and dance in the 1990s. The other half demonstrated their lack of interest with their feet. Cameron failed to see the position this left Salmond in. There was no overwhelming popular mandate for a referendum and therefore, no need to hold one. Referendums were still something of a novelty in UK politics, and Cameron could have refused point blank to sanction one and simply congratulated Mr Salmond on a victory that gave him a majority in the Scottish parliament, whose remit is devolved matters. The Constitution is not a devolved matter but a reserved one.\u0026nbsp; But, for whatever reason, Cameron surrendered, almost casually, to Salmond’s bluster. No doubt he thought that any referendum would return a massive result in favour of the UK and that that would put an end to the matter. Before Cameron ever entered any discussions with Salmond, he should have already had his agenda established, but there seems to have been none. If he had had any sense, he would have cast about for precedents to gauge the range of possibilities. He would have found that EU countries do not allow their regions to choose to secede.\u0026nbsp; A particularly telling example is Spain, where the new Constitution of 1977 specifically prohibits secession. He might have considered the most recent precedent in a democratic country, the case of Quebec in Canada, where two referendums were held, in 1980 and 1995. In the separatist referendum in Quebec in 1980, 59.56 per cent of the population voted to remain in Canada against 40.44 per cent who voted for secession. Fifteen years later, another referendum kept Quebec in Canada by the narrowest of margins: 50.58 per cent to 49.42 per cent. It was after that that the Canadian federal government began to take the issue seriously.\u0026nbsp; After much cogitation and discussion, the Canadian government in 2000 passed a Clarity Act, to set down in clear terms the conditions for a referendum and its outcome. The result essentially means that a democratic vote in itself would have no legal effect, since the secession of a Canadian province would only be constitutionally valid after a negotiation between the federal government and the provincial government whose people would have unambiguously expressed, by a clear majority, that it no longer wished to be part of Canada. Only then could a province leave confederation. The federal government gave no undertaking that it would recognise a vote for secession, and there was disquiet on the federal side that such a momentous decision could be taken on the basis of 50 per cent plus 1 vote – as has also applied in the UK – and that the 1995 vote had been won only so very narrowly.\u0026nbsp; The Clarity Act of 29 June 2000 gave the Canadian House of Commons the right to decide, before a vote could be held, whether a referendum question was sufficiently unambiguous. It also ruled out any proviso about pre-referendum negotiations between the governments of Quebec and Canada: any future referendum had to be about secession, and secession alone. That much was clear: there was to be no fudging of the issue with mitigating promises of ‘association’ with Canada after secession to attract ‘soft yes’ voters. Further, the Clarity Act gave the House of Commons the authority to decide, after the vote, whether a clear majority had expressed a view in favour of secession, implying that some kind of supermajority might be required. The House of Commons was also assigned authority to decide whether a referendum had violated any of the terms of the Clarity Act.\u0026nbsp; But Cameron didn’t study precedent. He negligently allowed Salmond to choose the terms of the referendum. Salmond allowed 16-year olds (whom he believed were more likely to be pro-separatist) the vote for the first time. He also chose the question, although the Electoral Commission struck down his original version: ‘Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?’ because it was asking a leading question. No self-respecting examiner asks for a reply that suggests that there is something wrong with you if you do not agree with the proposition. The resulting question, ‘Should Scotland be an independent country?’, still gave Salmond a massive advantage. It is estimated that a ‘yes’ answer gives an advantage of up to 7 per cent, because many people prefer to give a positive answer rather than a negative answer.\u0026nbsp; The most damaging advantage that Cameron allowed Salmond was over the choice of the date of the referendum. As part of the Edinburgh Agreement, he should have insisted ‘that this vote be held within a year of the Edinburgh Agreement’, that is, in 2013. That would have been perfectly reasonable. But Salmond wanted the most favourable of conditions for his own side. The year 2014 was totemic for him. Not only was it the seven hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, but Glasgow had been chosen to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014, thus showcasing Scotland to the world. This huge blunder by Cameron allowed the SNP two years in which they could drip, drip, drip their poisonous lies and anti-English hatred into Scottish communities, through their vast network of activists.\u0026nbsp; It may seem harsh to blame Cameron for the untidy and unpleasant mess that we are now in. But he held all the cards and negligently gave them all away to an adversary who had thought long and hard about how to achieve Scottish secession. Perhaps one should convict Cameron merely of being naïve: he was behaving as a decent man would, but not as the kind of skilled negotiator a Prime Minister should be. Allowing Salmond any latitude for chicanery was a fatal misjudgement. The Canadian Clarity Act was, and remains, an excellent precedent, one that the UK should have adopted and still can. Only one political party has worked that out and incorporated the adoption of a Clarity Act into its manifesto. That party is All4Unity, the party led by Jamie Blackett and founded by George Galloway, which is contesting list seats only. I leave voters to draw their own conclusion.

Here is the “vision” with my comments in bold. 1) The Scotland we want to see should lead with integrity, honesty, humility and transparency, in a self-sufficient and innovative way, and actively include the people of Scotland in decision making.\u0026nbsp; Didn\u0027t Nicola say we already had that? 2) Authorities have a duty to publish information that is valid, accurate, reliable, verifiable and accessible to all. You mean like on the Salmond Enquiry and the ready availability of the \"expert advice” driving your\u0026nbsp;Covid strategy?\u0026nbsp; 3) The Scotland that we would want to see would be leaders in innovation, with an obligation to invest in people to create jobs, confidence, development and growth.\u0026nbsp; Agreed, but isn\u0027t that what Skills Development Scotland, Scottish Enterprise, Scottish Investment Bank, our education system, and the myriad of SNP Quangos are supposed to be doing, funded by our taxes? In fact 15% of it is funded by additional tax money from rUK, so maybe it’s their fault. 4)\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Scotland should be a country where the people of Scotland have properly resourced and managed health \u0026amp; social care services, built around individuals and communities to achieve good health and wellbeing for all.\u0026nbsp; So isn\u0027t that what we have already under devolution, or do we just need more money, or, hang on, do you think we need ‘independence’ first. Don\u0027t be shy, just say it! 5) In order to achieve a better standard of living and opportunities for all we must invest in accessible, relevant training, support and improved income through a realistic living wage.\u0026nbsp; Agreed, did you discuss how that would be achieved then, and isn\u0027t this the same\u0026nbsp; as 3) above? 6) Scotland should be a country where all taxes are simplified and made more proportionate so that everyone is taxed accordingly; taxation is transparent and understandable; measures are introduced to minimise tax avoidance: and companies are incentivised to adopt green values.\u0026nbsp; What does that first sentence mean? Higher taxes starting at a lower income level? Just say it, we can take it!! Can\u0027t we? 7) Scotland should be a country where people are supported out of poverty by identifying and removing barriers to employment, education and housing.\u0026nbsp; Is that nor a rewrite of 3) and 5)? Education and housing are devolved powers. The SNP has overseen their decline for the past 13 years. 8) Scotland should be a country where the people and government communicate with each other honestly and respectfully; whilst working together with concise and factual information, based on openness and accountability. Unless you’re round the family dinner table and Humza’s hate police are listening in.\u0026nbsp; 9) The Scotland we want to see will provide support, education, growth opportunities and security for all young people to realise their potential, both physically and mentally, regardless of their background with a view to securing their future and that of our country.\u0026nbsp; You mean back to the 50\u0027s,\u0026nbsp;60\u0027s and 70\u0027s, before devolution, when I grew up in a Council house, got a great education and a platform to enable me to realise my potential? 10)\u0026nbsp;Scotland should be a country where we encourage and support everyone to reach their full potential through support and training. Providing fair and equality-driven opportunities, through personal development, with a focus on life and vocational skills, apprenticeships and hands-on experience.\u0026nbsp; Did you not just say that in 9), 7), 5) and 3)? Are you sure you selected a representative sample by age, demography, political views etc? Sounds like there was a lot of doddery 65+ year olds like me, repeating themselves over and over again. All this is the most bland political theatre. It\u0027s almost as if they had chopped up all 175,900 words in the SNP’s “Scotland’s Future” 2014 Indyref manifesto and removed the ones referring to the things people actually care about — “currency”, “independence”, “borders”, debt, CFE, gender, pensions and Brexit — tipped the remaining pile on a big table and left the delegates cherry pick (pun intended) the most blandly agreeable of the rest. Obviously, this will never be on the BBC or STV Sturge 0’Clock News because it doesn’t advance the case of \u0027independence\u0027 one iota, however we can share this glaring waste of money on social media, in the letters pages of the papers, and to our friends, family and colleagues. The Citizens\u0027 Assemblies are the Scottish Parliament in miniature: an expensive talking shop that produces bland proposals that always seem to push towards separation, while doing nothing to help the issues that people actually care about.

In the tragedy of Scottish politics, the comedy is becoming absurd. The SNP, mired in a civil war that is very much the Judean People\u0027s Front against the People\u0027s Front of Judea, are now seeing the arrival of the Judean People\u0027s Front crack suicide squad, as always confident that \"that will show \u0027em\". For years the SNP have shared, encouraged and supported Wings Over Scotland, a Nationalist website run by Reverend Stu Campbell (residence Bath, England). It is the most viewed political website on Scottish government computers. And it is a sewer of outlandish comparisons, whataboutery and misinformation. The SNP were all too happy to support Wings, until they came out against the Sturgeonite faction by supporting Alex Salmond’s allegations. To his credit, Campbell has done a lot of investigative work which has undermined the credibility of the Sturgeonites, and has been quick to challenge the party on issues such as the GRA, the party\u0027s record in government, the Salmond affair, and the SNP\u0027s commitment to illegal referendums.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/blairmcdougall/status/1362062547961143300?s=20 The Sturgeonite response has been typically Stalinist. All records of involvement with Wings Over Scotland by SNP members are being rapidly deleted, tweets and posts have been erased and pictures altered. A full purge in a desperate attempt to distance the SNP Sturgeonites from the Salmond loyalists.\u0026nbsp; This move underlines the fundamental hypocrisy of the SNP. They were happy to champion this source of calculated misinformation, that has inspired a considerable portion of the hate and anger that has gripped our country for the last decade, until they themselves became the focus of the site’s attacks. Now they call out Wings, not for the damage it has done to Scotland, but because of the damage it is doing to the SNP. They would never have done so if Wings was on the side of the Sturgeonites.\u0026nbsp; This factionalism represents a significant escalation in the civil war that has gripped the SNP. Previous purges have been limited within its political elite, targeting politicians like Joanna Cherry and other Salmond loyalists. This fighting, while damaging, has largely been contained. https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1363161017488932865 But now, the civil war has reached the grassroots. The fight is no longer between SNP hierarchy on the benches of Westminster and Holyrood, but between an increasingly deranged party orthodoxy and a popular, influential and far-reaching grassroots organisation. Many of those grassroots were already teetering on the cliff edge of loyalty and trust in the SNP, upset at the party’s glacial progress towards a second referendum. This will only push them over the edge.\u0026nbsp; An observer might look at this and wonder. Why encourage electoral suicide by widening a civil war to the grassroots when you are already seen as detached and aloof? Wings, for all the ludicrous misinformation it spreads, still has significant power to target voters. The SNP are alienating their most committed voters right when the party is coming under pressure on all fronts. From the suppression of the OECD report into Scotland’s educational performance, the failure to provide adequate COVID PPE, defeat on business rates, cutting farm subsidies and crippling the hospitality sector (and that is just today’s headlines). How much more damage when Salmond gives evidence in a few days? This is a fight the SNP could not afford to start. But, they started it anyway.\u0026nbsp; I know that it may be easy to dismiss these events as nothing more than a spat on Twitter, but\u0026nbsp; they speak to so much more. They speak to a bloated arrogant party at war with itself, and now at war with its support base. Each step the SNP has taken to appease the factions has backfired and only driven them further apart. They seem incapable of holding themselves together because, after 14 years of governmental shambles, they are being exposed.\u0026nbsp; The battles the SNP will have to endure in the coming months are escalating rapidly; the Salmond Affair is coming to it’s first peak, the OECD report might be published, campaigning will start by the opposition, and the road to recovery from the pandemic is still long and hard. For this war, the SNP will need all the soldiers it can lay its hands on, but they have purged the officer corps and are now targeting the infantry. Their battlecry is nothing more than an empty promise.","date":"2021-02-22","summary":"Comedy is at its best when it reflects tragic reality.

But that\u0027s not Nicola, she\u0027s a total control freak. She wouldn\u0027t do that. This video confirms rising concern by both Sturgeon’s opponents and admirers that her Government has become a one-woman show. The prime example of her control freakery is her daily media briefings. There is simply no need for the First Minister to be hosting these broadcasts herself. They should be handled by the Health Minister and her scientific advisers. But when your Health Minister is the inept Jeane Freeman, a minister responsible for sending hospital patients with COVID into health care homes, then what can you do? Despite a litany of scandals, Freeman, just like John Swinney, who presided over the exams debacle, is still in position. If these incompetents were working in a company they’d be long gone. They only stay in position because to fire them would damage Sturgeon’s image. She can’t trust them, but she can’t get rid of them. Recently it was revealed that Sturgeon spends the entire morning prepping for these daily briefings. As outsiders, we may say that this is not a good use of her time, but Nicola knows that when she gets up there to say that she’s in control, and emotes, and says that she’s doing better than Boris (even when she isn’t) she’ll be seen as the one in charge and her ratings will go up. Of course they are political. A measure of this success hit me recently when a family member said to me: ’I don’t like Nicola Sturgeon, but she’s doing so much better than the English’. Nicola’s appearances had not only won her over, despite there being barely any difference in the death rates between countries, but had also made her unwittingly talk like a Scottish Supremacist. But, while this exposure has resulted in a 49% positive approval rating, there are many dangers. A core feature of Nationalism is centralisation of power around its leader. But, when a leader doesn’t delegate, their leadership becomes brittle. While many of us would like to make all the decisions ourselves, you have to let go and let others make them for you, for good or bad. It\u0027s called management. It can be hard to let go. When we were growing our magazine business in Japan, it took the hiring of five editors before we finally found one who could do the job better than we could. It’s very satisfying to delegate work to talented people who can build something stronger than you yourself ever could. One-person shows are never as strong as a group of people all working together, using all their skills. But who in the SNP has any skills outside politics? Swinney, Freeman and most of the Nationalists are, almost entirely career politicians, a cosy group of teenage activists and political students who have grown up having barely worked in the real world at all. They might think they know politics, but they are amateurs at everything else. This is not a time for one professional politician leading a bunch of amateurs. Just look at the way the restaurant and bar lockdown was handled. There was no consultation with parliament. There was no proposal, no amendments, no objections, and no vote. There was no consultation with business owners or industry groups. There was no understanding of the issues that these businesses, their owners and their employees face at all. No apparent consultation with the Health or Business Ministers. There was no challenge to the scientific advice. There was just a single, unchallenged, centralised decision made by one person, Nicola Sturgeon, the control freak, based on dubious scientific evidence. If it’s going to be a one-woman show, can we at least cut out all the unnecessary ministerial salaries? We only found out last week that Christina McKelvie and Shirley-Anne Somerville, Ministers for Older People and Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People (again), have barely uttered a word during this crisis, despite being paid £95,000 a year ministers\u0027 salaries. Come to think of it, if all the decisions are going to be made by one person, let\u0027s just remove Holyrood entirely and just have a single First Minister. A Secretary of State for Scotland perhaps? So much for getting the \u0027government \u0027 you vote for! A reckoning is coming. By making herself the face of the crisis, Sturgeon has nowhere to hide. If she’d let her Health Minister take all the heat she could bin her near the end and then she’d walk away clean. But she wanted the exposure. She wanted the glory. She wanted to appear to have done better than Boris and ‘The English’. And while that has given her high approval ratings for now, we all know that, in politics, approval can evaporate VERY quickly. Her foolish policy of trying to eradicate the virus has failed (as it always would). People and businesses are upset about her unscientific and arbitrary lockdowns. The public is getting cranky about more restrictions. And she’s still got to face the full wrath of Alex Salmond. Even her most ardent fans must know that her position is weakening daily. As she becomes more exposed she’ll find herself more isolated, with no-one to back her. After all, if she didn’t trust them, why should they trust her?

Within the past couple of weeks, we learned that the primary responsibility of Public Health Scotland is not, as some may have assumed, the public health of Scotland but rather the protection of SNP ministers. Furthermore, we learned that highly-touted “world-leading” policies on education, climate policy, transport and a myriad of other departments all fail, with no oversight. It’s a protection racket that’s crippling Scotland’s services, economy and reputation. Why does the SNP rely so fundamentally on secrecy to govern? Is it to protect their external reputation? Well, they do rely on the misinformed to support them. Is it to hide their failures? They certainly have enough of those, and perhaps increasingly too many to hide. Is it simply the machinations of power when used by Nationalists? Certainly, but there is still more to it.\u0026nbsp; The answer is simple: the SNP rely so much on secrecy because they do not believe you have a need, or even a right, to know what they are doing. After 14 years in power, they cannot even entertain the idea that anyone but them could be in power in Scotland, and so they also cannot entertain the idea that anyone but them needs to know the realities of their rule. As far as the SNP are concerned, you don\u0027t need to know, so you shall not know. Many lament the state of opposition within Scottish politics, though it is encouraging that the heat has been turned up since the election. However, even within the SNP, there is no drive to challenge the leadership to improve. Partly this is because the SNP keep their internal dealings secret from their own members.\u0026nbsp; We need only look at the growing funding scandal to realise this. SNP backbenchers, and the vast majority of the party itself, exist only to provide cover for a party and administration run by a single individual, their spouse and a small cabal of die-hard loyalists. Anyone who finds themselves outside of this group is kept in ignorance because they are seen as a hindrance to the individual objectives of the rulers.\u0026nbsp; This is, of course, an extremely unhealthy manner for a parish council to be run, let alone the whole of Scotland. Still, it is the inevitable outcome of the power grabs and centralisation campaign that the SNP have waged over the last 14 years. This allows them to continue in power by keeping the electorate and the media sedated with grandiose power promises and trivial bribes.\u0026nbsp; So how is this cycle broken, and how is the secrecy exposed? The answer is, as usual, momentum. Failing to secure a majority has taken the wind from the SNP\u0027s sails, and combined with the growing unease within the party as support for the UK increases, means that it is highly unlikely that the SNP will want to have another vote anytime soon.\u0026nbsp; The odds are stacked against them, and to lose again would see any future requests laughed out of parliament for the next 50 years, if not forever. Failure would give the UK Government free rein to legislate to make any future vote virtually impossible, as was done in Canada after Quebec\u0027s second attempt.\u0026nbsp; So, all that is left is searching for an exit for the party leadership. If this funding scandal claims Peter Murrell, SNP CEO and Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s husband, she won\u0027t be far behind him in leaving. And when they finally leave, the wall of secrecy they have hidden behind will come crashing down. Whatever remains of the SNP will be forced to deal with the fallout: Secrets laid bare, no leadership, no chance of \"one more push\" and a membership at a loss as to who to blame. But the public will know. The SNP have relied on secrecy since their formation and have relied on it ever more over the last 14 years. It has become their greatest electorate asset, but it is also their greatest strategic vulnerability because, as we were all told as children, the truth always comes out and its consequences are made even greater because it was concealed. Secrecy built the SNP, and secrecy will one day destroy it. Angus Robinson is a lecturer at a UK university.

A few quid perhaps? Maybe ten or twenty quid at a stretch? No… in fact it turns out it costs £357 to change a lightbulb at the Scottish parliament building. Some £1.75 Million was spent on upgrading lights in the devolved assemblies’ debating chamber in 2016-7, working out at an astonishing £357 apiece. That same year, costs ranged from £25.6 Million in staff salaries, to £15.8 Million in parliamentary expenses. All in all, the total bill for the devolved assembly came in at a whopping £95,600,000. Perhaps such largesse should not be surprising; after all the ugly carbuncle that is this Scottish parliament building famously came in at a total cost of £414,000,000 to construct; roughly ten times over budget and three years late, to boot. Like most pro-Union Scots, despite all this, I used to be perfectly comfortable with devolution. It seemed like a half-way house that could allow us to get the best of both worlds, while winning over soft Unionists who might otherwise be tempted by Nationalism. The original theory, infamously stated by Labour Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, George Robertson, was that “devolution will kill Nationalism stone dead”. In the aftermath of the 2014 referendum, it very quickly became clear to me that this was not the case. Despite the comprehensive victory of the pro-Union majority, the devolved administration immediately demonstrated that it had no intention of accepting the result. The SNP began to aggressively agitate for a second referendum, from almost the very moment they were defeated, and significantly, Holyrood was their chief platform to do this. The SNP are so obsessed with this drive for another unwanted, divisive referendum that they have entirely neglected all their duties of devolved government. In so far as they have legislated, they have done so with the sole purpose of making Scotland’s laws and regulation different from those in the rest of the UK.\u0026nbsp; I realised then, that not only is Holyrood the SNP’s platform to push for another referendum, the very fact of devolved government diminishes the bonds that bind our United Kingdom together. When Scotland has its own separate legislature, laws, regulations and quasi-national leader in the form of the First Minister, then by proportion, we cease to share these things in common with the rest of our British family. Devolution – independent of who is actually in charge at Holyrood – in and of itself, diminishes the bonds that actively maintain our unity. In its current form, Devolution goes massively beyond what was instituted on the back of the 1997 referendum. Since then we’ve had several enormous power grabs by Holyrood: for example, the devolution of railways in 2005; of conservation, fishing, wind and wave energy in 2008; of borrowing, spending and a host of taxation powers through the Scotland Act 2012; of the Crown Estate, welfare and everything from road signs to gas extraction through the Scotland Act 2016. These are all powers that the SNP have mis-managed, yet nobody voted for any of that to be devolved in the 1997 referendum. Despite this, the pro-devolutionary consensus in Scotland’s political and media establishment is truly stifling. It was a New Labour government that introduced the Scottish parliament and it was a Conservative government that, in 2016, legislated for the biggest single transfer of powers to the Scottish parliament in its history. All three mainstream Unionist parties remain champions of devolution (indeed further devolution in the case of Labour and the Lib Dems), and have legislated thoughtlessly for it while in power. But enough is enough. I am one of a growing number of Scots who now support the full abolition of the Scottish parliament and the repeal of legislative devolution. One major Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times last year placed support for abolition at 22%, with a remarkable 57% of Conservative voters and even a quarter of Labour voters backing it. For context, around 5.5-6% of the vote will typically elect an MSP in any of Scotland’s list regions at a Holyrood election (presuming that party has not won any constituency seats). Next year’s Holyrood elections are an opportunity to change the agenda; to stop talking about another separation referendum and start moving constitutional debate in the other direction by making scrapping Holyrood the primary talking point. The Nationalists won’t like that one bit! That’s why I co-founded the Abolish The Scottish Parliament Party and will stand in the Scottish Elections in May 2021 on a platform to abolish the wasteful Scottish Government, get rid of 129 excess MSPs, finally end pointless constitutional arguments, and put the £100 million saved back into the NHS and education. I believe that Scotland’s political needs can be adequately handled by a return to local authority control with Scotland-wide projects being better served by our current Scottish MPs, working with an empowered Scottish Office that can spend directly on Scottish infrastructure. We’re bringing together a great team of candidates from all political backgrounds. We will be contesting the regional lists only, and not constituency seats, in order to maximise the pro-UK vote and get the SNP out. Like all voters currently under the age of forty, I was too young to vote in the devolution referendum of 1997. In fact, I was in primary school at the time! But now, in the 2020s I hope to finally give anti-devolution Scots a voice, and shake up the cosy Holyrood establishment that has gone unchallenged for far too long.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;John Mortimer is the Leader of the Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party.

Living in South Lanarkshire, for me, Edinburgh often feels 550 miles away from home, while London feels 30 miles away. Holyrood and the devolution settlement, to this day, has been a complete failure. Tony Blair destroyed our United Kingdom’s unity by handing the Scottish Nationalists a parliament to breed dissent and grievance in.\u0026nbsp; Instead of intervening and regulating the devolved government, all UK governments, post-devolution, have failed to see the division that many politicians sent to the devolved chambers were spreading. They have allowed voters to believe that a party with the word “national” in their name, were the only ones who truly cared about Scotland. They have portrayed Conservatives as imperial masters holding them in some kind of horrific jail cell, that drains Scotland of wealth and prosperity, when the complete opposite is true. I am proud of our United Kingdom in every single possible way. We live in the greatest country in the world. To destroy it would be cutting our nose off to spite our face.

He then went on to secure the seat again in the 2019 General Election. Viewed as “one to watch” he secured a position as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. However, as a protest at Boris Johnston’s defence of Dominic Cummings, against the Prime Minister’s wishes, Douglas resigned from his position in Government.\u0026nbsp; Now, at the age of only 37, he has returned to the fold, and is taking on the mammoth task of defending the Union in Scotland and plans on ousting Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister of Scotland in the Scottish Parliamentary Elections of May 2021.\u0026nbsp; Can he do it?

Douglas’s background, ethics, morals and vision for our country matters abundantly more to the voters I speak to on the doorsteps, than putting our country through another decade of constitutional arguments and friction between our two governments. He can, and will, unite the anti-Nationalist vote (Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative) to pull Nicola Sturgeon off her cloud. I have never been so upbeat about our Party’s prospects. We have a leader with a clear vision, a young vision and a true desire to unite our people, to stop the grievance and get on with governing Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Douglas Ross is the man to send Nicola Sturgeon packing and that is why I unequivocally back him to lead my party and my country. Help The Majority fight back In just a few weeks, The Majority has grown to over 6000 social media followers and hundreds of thousands of article views. But, we still have a long way to go to beat Nationalist media, like The National newspaper, which pumps out ugly propaganda to over 100,000 followers. If you can, please pledge a monthly donation so that we can grow and be an even stronger voice against the ugly Nationalism that has engulfed Scotland.

IPSO concluded that The National newspaper fabricated tweets and breached the Editors\u0027 Code in a video and article it published in April. The Majority was made aware of this case a few weeks ago, but was not able to publish until it had been appealed and concluded. The ruling is part of a pattern of hideous behaviour at Newsquest, The National’s publisher, which not only publishes anti-English hate; it has provided platforms for two of Scotland’s most odious commentators. The newspaper, under editor Callum Baird, also intimidates those who stand against it, as evidenced by the flimsy articles he has published in an attempt to smear us and our writers. (We expect even more after this article). IPSO SLAPS THE NATIONAL\u0027S FAKE TWEETS The IPSO ruling comes from a video and accompanying article The National published on April 17, 2021, called ‘Indy Myths #3’, which is part of a series supposedly ‘debunking’ myths surrounding Scottish Nationalist’s aim of breaking up the UK, sorry, I mean ‘independence’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZQL7snyDC8 Indy Myths 3 The video features Lesley Riddoch, a Herald columnist, who was most recently seen hosting the ‘Big Indy Event’. Despite receiving hundreds of tweets informing her that Amanda Brown, one of the performers of the event, had been singing pro-IRA songs on social media, Riddoch did not drop the singer. Brown still has pro-IRA songs on YouTube. More on this in an upcoming article.\u0026nbsp; Also appearing were the Nationalist journalist Pat Kane, a drag queen called Lady Rampant, Mairi McAllen SNP MSP for Clydesdale and Professor Richard Murphy, an Nationalist accountant who doesn’t even know how to figure out deficit percentages. The tweets included such gems as: \u0027Scotland should never be allowed back in the EU\u0027 and \u0027Scotland has to rely on England to subsidise it\u0027, while other tweets were displayed on screen: \u0027Love the kids, love the wife, hate Europe!\u0027, \u0027It makes no sense to leave one Union and enter another\u0027, and \u0027How can Scotland compete on the world stage without Westminster’s help?’ which were all purportedly from pro-UK accounts. These ‘well-known Yessers’ then reacted to the tweets. Only problem: The accounts were not real and the statements had not been made by real people. The tweets had been faked by The National.\u0026nbsp; Unintentional irony Lovatt complained to IPSO, saying, \u0027The statements included had not just been ascribed to fabricated accounts, they had not been made by any genuine Twitter users at all, and the publication was therefore fabricating its own myths.’ FABRICATING ITS OWN MYTHS In response, the newspaper claimed that it used fake tweets because using real ones would lead to \u0027harassment of individuals online\u0027, a tacit admission that those who speak out against Scottish Nationalism will be cyberbullied by The National\u0027s own readers. The IPSO Committee ruled that not disclosing that the tweets were fake constituted a failure to take care not to publish \u0027significantly misleading\u0027 information, breaching the Editors\u0027 Code Clause 1 (i): Editor\u0027s Code Clause 1 (i): Accuracy - The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\u0026nbsp; The Committee ruled: Given the nature of the video, which was presented as a series of “rebuttals”, the presentation of the material as genuine rather than a creation by the publication was significantly misleading and required clarification under Clause 1 (ii) of the Editors’ Code.\u0027 The National has been forced to issue a clarification that the tweets were faked on both the article and the video: Clarification: To avoid any confusion, we would like to clarify that the ”daft tweets” that appeared in this video, such as those from “Hardhat Man”, “Concerned Stud”, “Very Patient Labour Girl” and “Unionist Journalist”, were not actually from real Twitter accounts or indeed real people. We made them up for the purposes of this video. We made them up The full IPSO ruling is here. QUESTIONS The episode raises several questions: Firstly, if Scottish Separation is so great, why do you have to lie about it? It’s bad enough that the National lies about ‘independence’ each and every day, telling its readers that #indyref2 is coming, when there is zero chance of that happening. But to manufacture fake tweets to promote a reaction from a bunch of has-beens? The barrel has been scraped. Secondly, were Lesley Riddoch, Pat Kane, Lady Rampant, Mairi McAllen and Richard Murphy in on the deception? This is especially worring for Kane, a journalist who styles himself as the independence movement\u0027s thought leader. If he, and the other participants, knew the tweets were fake they should apologise to the public for misleading them. Or were they also fooled by The National\u0027s editorial team? In that case, The National needs to apologise to them.\u0026nbsp; Thirdly, what disciplinary measures have been taken against the creator of the video and The National\u0027s editor, Callum Baird, for allowing this deception to be published?\u0026nbsp;What measures have been taken by Newsquest to make sure this doesn\u0027t happen again? Finally, why are Newsquest’s CEO, Henry Faure Walker, and Mike Reed, CEO of Gannett, funding The National’s fake news?\u0026nbsp; WHAT IS GOING ON AT NEWSQUEST? In the past year, the company has engaged in a number of dubious hires. Despite having a verifiable history of offensive tweets and documented abusive online history, of which I have been a victim, Donald Martin, Editor-in-Chief of Newsquest Scotland, hired Janey Godley, the comedian, as a columnist for the Herald. When Godley was hired, I cancelled my subscription and wrote a letter of complaint. Having her coarse and vile Nationalist rantings delivered to my inbox was a step too far. But it wasn’t until The Sun and The Daily Beast uncovered even more abuse, including racist tweets, that Godley was forced to step down from fronting the Scottish Governmnet\u0027s COVID ads and apologise for her behaviour. Instead of exposing Godley\u0027s vile history, the Herald hired her. By the way, I still, haven’t had an apology from Janey. But, at the same time, Donald Martin also hired Lesley Riddoch, who, as noted above, hired a terrorist-supporting singer for her Big Indy Event. It was surprising to me then, and even more so now, that The Herald would tie itself so strongly to Scottish Nationalism, when every poll shows support for a second referendum in decline, not to mention that there is no path to the fantasy of a second referendum. And now we have The National’s editor, Callum Baird, who not only published fake tweets, but tried to brush them off as inconsequential in response to me last night. Three awful hires in the same company from a company that continues to publish The National, a newspaper that exists only to amplify division, based on the lost cause of Scottish ‘independence’. Why is a major UK company publishing such hate? Why is a US company like Gannett, which I have a lot of respect for, funding hate? Why was a person who made abusive and racist tweets given a platform? Why is someone who thinks nothing of hiring a terrorist supporter also given a platform by the same company? In the past, with a compliant Scottish media and a cowed majority, this abuse might have been able to continue. But, our community is growing stronger every day. Ordinary people are rejecting this vile and ugly Nationalism and those who profit from promoting it. CUT OUT THIS CANCER I direct you to Newsquest’s editorial policy: Our local newspapers are politically neutral in that they are not affiliated with a particular political party or movement.Newsquest news brands aim to provide accurate reports of news, views and local life to a high professional standard.\u0026nbsp; We want to be the authoritative source of local news that readers can trust. The National’s masthead clearly states, in defiance of Newsquest’s Editorial policy, that it is the ‘Only Scottish newspaper that supports an independent Scotland. The National is a propaganda rag that is unashamedly affiliated to Scottish Nationalism, a movement that, masquerading as a noble ‘independence’ movement, actually aims to break up the UK and diminish all of its citizens. Its history of fake tweets, disinformation and division shows that it cannot be trusted, while its very existence shows that Newsquest cannot be trusted to enforce its own policies.\u0026nbsp; Something is very wrong. There is a cancer in Newsquest. I urge Henry Faure Walker, CEO of Newsquest to cut out the sickness at the heart of Newsquest in Scotland. If he doesn\u0027t, Mike Reed, CEO of Gannett should remove him before it gets any worse.. Mark Devlin is the publisher of The Majority.

But federalism isn\u0027t the benign cuddly sheep it first appears to be. It\u0027s the nationalist wolf in disguise, ready to divide and devour the UK. Federalism, like all attempts to appease nationalism, will only further aid the fragmentation of the constitutional cohesion of our country, and should be opposed by all those who want to maintain its integrity. Federalists generally propose two ideas: Firstly, they propose that the UK is split into smaller governmental regions. Proposals include creating an English parliament, as well as the existing Scottish, Welsh and Irish governments, or to split England into smaller regions. Scottish federalists often propose that each region has approximately five to six million people in it, to match the population of Scotland. However, this arbitrary population number does not take into account the history, geography and social ties in the regions. Just as one could say that the one-size-fits-all Scottish parliament does not take into account the many different kinds of Scottish regions. Secondly, federalists propose that each federal unit would have a ‘parliament’ that would be responsible for all of that region’s affairs, except defence, foreign affairs, immigration and financial regulation (in theory). The ‘mainstream’ political parties, the Conservative and ‘Unionist’ Party, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats, now wholeheartedly support a policy of introducing federalism to the UK. By this, they mean giving the devolved legislatures as much power over purely local (Scottish, Welsh, and NI) affairs as possible, regardless of whether England has a Parliament or not, although the Conservatives would, in all likelihood, make Westminster the parliament that looks after purely English matters. They support such a policy because they think it is an alternative to separation. However, they have not thought through the consequences properly, or perhaps aren\u0027t concerned with the possibility of it being used by anti-UK nationalists and their allies to further their agenda of breaking up the UK. Why it doesn’t work There are several important reasons why federalism wouldn’t produce a viable, fair constitutional arrangement for the UK: It an extreme solution, based on fear Federalists would like us\u0026nbsp;to believe that they are offering a moderate middle-ground compromise between separation and centralisation. But federalism is an extreme solution, based on fear. It dismantles the Parliamentary Union begun in 1707 and is an extremist attack on the constitutional nature of the UK as a unitary (single) nation. Wanting to maintain the UK is not an extreme position – trying to break up the UK, or trying to change things to the benefit of those who want to break up the UK, is. Only a paper thin wall separates federalism from separatism. Any political party which advocates \u0027federalism\u0027 sets itself up as the weaker version of a stronger brand. It hurts itself, and only benefits those who see federalism as just a stepping stone towards separation, towards the break-up of the UK.\u0026nbsp; Federalism will NOT stop Scottish, or Welsh or Northern Irish nationalism from trying to break up the UK. Such anti-UK nationalists are monomaniacal and pathological about forcing separation on their part of the UK. It has been a constant mantra of pro-legislative devolutionists since the beginning of the devolution era 25 years ago, that giving the devolved parts of the UK more powers would negate anti-UK nationalism. The reality has been the opposite. Over the past 25 years, legislative devolution has empowered nationalism. Giving Holyrood more powers, for instance, has done nothing to negate the efforts of the SNP to force independence in Scotland. Indeed, the SNP are actively using the power and money of government to advance their agency, both overtly, in areas such as overseas offices and ‘Ministers for independence’, and covertly, through the funding of civil society. It would destabilise the UK Federalism actually gives nationalists more of what they want. It makes it far easier for them to assert that ‘only one more step\u0027 is required to achieve separation. It actually empowers them to stir up division in society. The mainstream UK political parties believe such a policy is an election winner, but they fail to consider what will happen in future elections when the nationalists get back into power.\u0026nbsp; If a federal UK state was ever created, the SNP (and the other anti-UK nationalists) would simply continue on as if nothing had happened and continue to pursue their separation agenda again. They would ignore the fact of devolution and claim that the UK is still ‘centralised with real power in London’, just as they act like the Scottish parliament never happened. They would also continue on, without even recognizing what they have been given. Nothing but complete separation would satisfy them. They would just use their very substantially enhanced new federal powers to agitate with their now greatly enhanced ability (via their federal legislature and its much greater powers) for more independence referenda. It would make the citizens of the federated regions of the UK ‘stare at their navel’ and obsess over the divisive independence agenda, rather than focus on the wider panoply of our UK unity, combined strength and shared national identity. And it would lead to extremist elements in the federated regions of the UK joining up to pool their efforts to break up the UK. It would centralise unpopular policies, while devolving popular ones Looking at Scotland, in a federal UK, Holyrood would be entirely responsible for health, education, social spending, and all the positive roles of government that are central to the SNP\u0027s vision of a centre-left Scotland and so consequently, tax and spend would take place almost entirely within Scotland, thus re-orientating the pooling and sharing of resources and the sense of national and economic community to the Scottish, rather than the UK, level.\u0026nbsp; This would contrast very sharply with the positive duties of the Scottish Government, as the federal UK parliament would be responsible only for things like defence, immigration and foreign intervention. These are often the unpopular and contentious issues, and the SNP could easily portray such a government as nasty, right-wing and having no mandate in Scotland. Federalism would create a situation where all Holyrood does is provide public services, while all the UK Parliament does is run Trident, detain refugees and bomb Syria. That is certainly how nationalists would frame the situation created by federalism, and it is hard to see the UK lasting under those circumstances.\u0026nbsp; It would cause a mass of conflicting laws\u0026nbsp; A major drawback to federalism would be the disparity in laws that it would create. Each federal unit would have their own laws, which creates a substantial potential to create conflict between the parts of the country, as some laws may be different from those in other parts of the federal union. Added to this, separatists in any region, would use this to agitate against the centre, just as the SNP has used Holyrood to agitate against Westminster under legislative devolution.\u0026nbsp; A good example of this is the Green Party/SNP’s bottle return scheme in Scotland (DRS). They proposed a plan to recycle used beverage bottles, where a deposit would be paid by a customer and returned when they brought the bottle back to a shop or machine after use.\u0026nbsp; However, drinks producers in Scotland and the rest of the UK were concerned about its impact on their businesses. Scottish drinks producers would see demand drop, as a 20p cost would be added to every single-use container, while any UK business that wanted to sell into Scotland would be subject to extra labelling restrictions. Wine distributors, for example, said that they would simply stop selling low-volume wines into Scotland, as it was not worth the extra costs. Due to these issues, and the Scottish Government’s inability to secure a UK Internal Market exemption, Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said the UK would not approve the scheme. In recent days, the UK Government has now confirmed that the proposed Green/SNP deposit return scheme can go ahead, but without the inclusion of glass bottles. If the SNP Holyrood administration accepts this stipulation, the scheme would be introduced north of the border from March 2024. The deposit charge, bar codes and labelling of drinks containers would all have to be standardised across the four parts of the UK, meaning that someone buying a drink in Dumfries and Galloway would be able to get their 20p back if they returned the bottle in Carlisle. In a letter to First Minister Humza Yousaf, the UK Government stressed that including glass in the Scotland only scheme could create a ‘permanent divergence’ in the market, as schemes planned for other parts of the UK did not include this.\u0026nbsp; Of course, that was not good enough for separatists who want to use the issue as a grievance about excessive Westminster control. Humza Yousaf has claimed it is a ‘democratic outrage’ for the UK Government to only allow the DRS to go ahead without glass. The Green Party’s Lorna Slater accused the UK Government of ‘sabotage’ and said it showed ‘utter disregard for devolution’. Ex-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon waded in to add to the controversy, claiming : ‘You can have devolved powers, but use them only if you do exactly what we tell you’, is not devolution in any meaningful sense. Increasingly obvious that real self-government requires independence’. This is just one small example of how anti-UK separatists would use the differences in local laws, to try to grab power they do not have, to create grievance and fuel antagonism with the rest of the UK. Now, imagine this multiplied by ten or more regions. It’s a recipe for chaos. It would centralise power away from smaller regions On most issues, it makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to the quality of the government if it is one mile away or 1,000 miles away. It can be equally good, or bad.\u0026nbsp; The experience of the Scottish parliament has shown how power and funding has been centralised in Edinburgh, instead of being spread across Scotland’s regions. Local councils funding has been cut severely so that the Scottish Government can pursue its agenda. Imagine this multiplied by ten regions across the UK. It would end the pooling and sharing of the UK’s resources.\u0026nbsp; It would break the shared UK-wide economic community. It would damage the social desire to pool the UK’s resources with people throughout the UK. Furthermore, it is all just economic pie-in-the-sky. There is absolutely no reason why a federal political set-up would deliver \u0027local and national redistribution of wealth, and collective democratic control over corporate capital\u0027, as its proponents claim, instead of something else. It would mean an endless stream of independence referenda, as well as the exploitation of political differences.\u0026nbsp; Crucially, it is likely to give anti-UK nationalism greatly enhanced power to hold referenda until they get the result they want. Currently, Westminster has the power to withhold consent for the devolved legislatures to hold referenda on independence, but imagine if this power had been in the hands of the SNP and if Scotland had already been in some kind of federal relationship with the rest of the UK immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016— it is unlikely the UK would still exist.\u0026nbsp; It would have been, legislatively, much easier for the SNP to use the Scottish \u0027Remain\u0027 (in the EU) vote to argue that Scotland had an undeniable right to stay in the EU. The idea that ‘we all voted as a United Kingdom’ would sound less convincing if the UK was actually a federation of four different nations. If the central UK Government overruled the SNP, then the SNP would be in a very powerful position to create a monumental fuss, which could possibly result in separation.\u0026nbsp; This did not happen, as the UK is still held together as a unitary nation. The Scottish vote was part of the wider UK vote on which the vote was predicated, not the results in each individual part of the UK, and so Scotland had to go along with the overall UK vote. It would have been harder to make that point if the UK had already been a federal union, or if Scotland already had the powers of a quasi-independent federal state. It would destroy the concept of the UK being a unitary state and focus everything on the four separate nations to the point where the parts of the UK would be constantly at each other\u0027s throats. In essence, federalism would make it easier for the SNP to exploit political differences in order to promote the break-up of the UK. Putting all these together, and looking at the disaster of Scottish devolution, it can only be concluded that Federalism would, in fact, make breaking up the UK far easier, not more difficult. Federalism hasn’t stopped separatist movements Federalism’s proponents point to other countries in the world as examples of success that the UK should emulate. However, they tend to emphasise the obvious successes, while ignoring the glaring failures. Countries like the US, Canada and Germany, though constitutionally cohesive at the moment, have growing popular separatist movements. ‘Calexit’ (taken from the UK’s ‘Brexit’ movement) is a thriving separatist movement in California that has substantial popular support on the ground. Indeed, California is, arguably, the most likely state to secede from the US Union. Added to this, there are at least 16 separatist movements all over America, and their number and popularity is only growing. It is easy to see one, or more of them, becoming so popular and influential that it becomes a real threat to the constitutional integrity of the US. Just as the SNP was very insignificant for decades until they suddenly became a real threat to the UK, enabled by legislative devolution. Like legislative devolution, federalism may seem like a great idea, but it doesn’t work in practice. Some people assert that federalism ‘works in other countries and so would also work in the UK’ but this isn’t the case when the real facts are ascertained and examined. Federalism can only work in the absence of separatist agitation, yet, as noted above, it emboldens exactly what it aims to neutralise. A federal unit with a significant separatist movement (like the SNP in Scotland) will constantly be at risk of its institutions being taken over, or co-opted, to promote a separatist agenda. Added to this, any country which has a significant separatist movement will see its federal parliament eventually dominated by separatists who will use it to push for full separation. In Canada, a federal union, the Quebecois, who have managed to seize power in the Quebec federal legislature and have held two referenda on seceding from Canada in the last forty-three years, are still active and a clear and present threat to the constitutional integrity of that country. There are 11 other separatist movements across Canada. In Europe, Catalonia has been trying to break away from the rest of Spain for decades, culminating in the 2017 referendum in which 92.1% of Catalonians voted ‘yes’ to separation. Then there’s the Basque separatist question. The Spanish federal union has spawned extremist nationalism that has employed terrorism in order to achieve its political aims, in the form of the ETA Basque separatists (Spain’s IRA). Hardly a ringing endorsement for a successful federal union. The Basque conflict, also known as the Spain–ETA conflict, was an armed and political conflict from 1959 to 2011, between Spain and the Basque National Liberation Movement, a group of social and political Basque organisations which sought independence from Spain and France. Germany has many popular separatist movements that are steadily growing in number and have the ominous potential to grow into a genuine threat to that country’s constitutional integrity in time, just like the SNP in Scotland. Far from producing a cohesive nation, the real-world experience of federal unions in Europe, the US, and Canada has been that it does no such thing. It holds no solutions for the UK’s constitutional crisis that legislative devolution has produced. Would it work if secession was banned? The only way that federalism could, perhaps, be made to work is if secession from the UK was actually banned by law. This approach is fraught with danger, however.\u0026nbsp; If secession was banned by law, then separatists would only be prevented from breaking up the UK in theory. While implementing such a law would be attacked by, for example, the SNP, as ‘anti-democratic’, and would be used as propaganda, the larger issue is that there would still be nothing to stop separatists in any region using the power of that region\u0027s government to break away from the UK. If enough support was garnered, through amplified separatist grievance, then the UK would not stand in the way.\u0026nbsp; This is because the UK would have made itself remote. Instead of\u0026nbsp;being woven through every region’s life, identity and social fabric, the central government will be seen as an even more remote overlord, not in touch with local people. It is then easy for separatists to prise themselves away. Federalism would merely be an extension of the disastrous devolution process that has been leading the UK down the path to separation since its introduction in the late 1990s. All the dangers laid out above also apply to the present situation under legislative devolution, only to a slightly lesser degree. That every mainstream political party in the UK is intent on going even further down this path is deeply concerning for anybody who wants to maintain the integrity of the UK.\u0026nbsp; Federalism and quasi-federalism are extremist attacks on the nature of the UK as primarily a unitary nation, which it has been since its inception 316 years ago. The proposals coming from the mainstream UK parties are barely less dangerous to the continuation of our country than those of the SNP, and show little commitment to defending it. To defeat separatism in the long term, the ongoing breakup of the UK must be reversed and Scotland must be reintegrated into the UK’s political life. This will only be achieved through closer union, not further degrees of separation. Beware the wolf.

Still, there is something virtuous about being the underdog in this fight. When it’s my turn on the soapbox I talk about what has been on my mind while driving. The lack of posters for any party, even the SNP, on my way here raises questions. Are the people of Scotland not going to vote? Have they lost interest in politics? Or is it that they are resigned to the outcome? The old parties have resigned themselves to contesting second place. Douglas Ross isn’t even standing in a constituency.

These are the people let down by the SNP’s misappropriation of the Covid Business Relief Funds. I hope they get their just desserts on Thursday. *** Every few minutes my phone rings with another friend asking for tactical voting advice. Usually they are from Dumfries and Galloway and the reply is simple: Lilac Tory, Orange All for Unity. It’s a scandal that, after 20 years, the Scottish electorate is so illiterate about how the d’Hondt voting system works. Of course the bigger parties have no intention of enlightening the proletariat and blithely campaign on slogans of Both Votes Tory or Both Votes SNP, knowing full well that lots of second votes will be wasted.\u0026nbsp; I hope that if nothing else, All for Unity has helped to make people more aware of how to make their second vote work better for them.

The Alliance for Unity is now an effective campaigning force that will be ready to take on where ‘Better Together’ left off, if need be. After the Scottish Tories’ extraordinary announcement that another independence referendum will happen if they don’t prevent an SNP majority, that may be sooner rather than later. It is extraordinary to think that All for Unity is now the only party standing on a No Referendum platform. *** Today, the last day of the campaign, we finish the soapbox tour outside Holyrood. George and I give our final speeches to camera for Youtube dubbed “Krankie Foes to Holyrood”. I’d love to see that headline on news stands this weekend.

Share widely... #5 Dude, where’s our superfast broadband? Lockdown measures over the last few months have really shown the importance of a reliable and fast broadband connection. In their 2016 election manifesto, the SNP proclaimed they would ensure “100% of premises across Scotland will have access to super-fast broadband by 2021.” Now, we aren’t in 2021 quite yet, but they are way, way behind that target and the SNP Minister responsible has already conceded that work on the new upgraded network will run past 2023. The situation is so bad that Conservative MSP Douglas Ross had to write himself a note of permission to go to work in the UK Parliament, staving off criticisms from Nationalists for him making an ‘unnecessary visit’ – but it was necessary, because the broadband where Mr Ross lives wasn’t up to dialling into Zoom for him to do his job. Repeat this for tens of thousands of desperate workers in this country.\u0026nbsp; Nicola Sturgeon has failed to connect, leaving Scotland’s communications infrastructure unfit for purpose. #4 Using Monopoly money to buy Scottish businesses In 2015, a £97m order was placed for two ferries, for the Isle of Arran and the Hebrides, at the Ferguson shipyards in Port Glasgow, which was seen as a lifeline contract to keep the Jim McColl-backed yard afloat. But SNP incompetence over the design of the ships ended up sinking the yard instead and leaving it in need of a Scottish Government bailout. The ferries are now more than three years behind schedule and will run to over £100m over budget.\u0026nbsp; Quite simply, a deficit which a normal commercial enterprise wouldn’t be able to sustain, but is being sustained by tax-paying Scots. Not content with a shipyard, six years ago the Scottish Government took over loss-making Prestwick Airport for £1 and have since plunged £50m of Scottish taxpayers money into stemming losses made by the operation. Definitely not ‘pure dead brilliant’. It remains to be seen whether the SNP will at least recover the monies taxpayers have spent on Prestwick over the years, or not.\u0026nbsp; But whoever thought it was a good idea should go straight to jail and not collect £200 as they pass Go.\u0026nbsp; And sadly, it’s not monopoly money they’re using - it’s our money. #3 Doctoring the figures The SNP pledged to recruit an additional 800 GPs over the next decade, however, a report from Audit Scotland stated the SNP government would struggle to meet that commitment. But with Stamp Duty being far more expensive in Scotland, and with doctors paying £2k a year more in taxes at the average salary level in Scotland versus elsewhere in the UK, it’s no wonder the Scottish Government are finding it harder to attract GPs to Scotland. The expansion of the primary care workforce, which includes nurses and physiotherapists, is “central” to the SNP’s vision of reshaping healthcare to treat more people at home and in the community, rather than in hospitals, but this is compromised by the difficulties in attracting new talent. In any case, with an ageing population and an increase in the number of people living with long-term medical conditions, these extra 800 places – if filled – will cater for the increase in demand, and not necessarily reduce the stressful workload GPs currently face. #2 Nationalism isn’t working Despite historic investment of over £10bn by the UK Government to intervene in the economy and throw a protective safety net around workers during the unprecedented impact of COVID-19, Scotland’s unemployment rate sits at 4.6%, way in excess of the other parts of the United Kingdom (England checks out at 3.9%, Wales 3%, and Northern Ireland leads, with only 2.3% of workers out of a job). This is after factoring in just over 628,000 jobs in Scotland have been protected by the UK Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which begs the question, exactly how bad would things be if Scotland had split from the rest of the UK?\u0026nbsp; The finances demonstrate an independent Scotland wouldn’t have had the financial means to pay for these support measures – the UK’s being one of the most generous in the world – and wouldn’t have had a lender of last resort to ensure the Government was able to even borrow the money if it so chose. Remember, it was the SNP’s official position to unilaterally continue using the Pound Sterling as the official currency of an independent Scotland. There’s a global pandemic on, and we need to throw an arm around our workers?\u0026nbsp; Sure, let’s phone a foreign power’s central bank to ask if we can write out a blank cheque in their currency… #1 Deaths from COVID testing failure Think Nicola is doing a great job at steering Scotland through this terrible pandemic?\u0026nbsp; Let’s talk about testing. At the end of May, Jeane Freeman stated Scotland had reached a testing capacity of 15,500 tests per day to adequately support the “Test and Protect” scheme as promoted by the Scottish Government. The opposition parties quickly pointed out that the SNP was only using around half of that capacity, and that they were failing to meet their key promise of providing testing for all care home staff on a regular basis – care homes being the major concern over the number of infections, and sadly, fatalities.\u0026nbsp; Despite a promise by ministers that the situation would “change dramatically as the new system comes into force,” on 3rd July official Scottish Government figures showed only 5,356 tests carried out by the NHS, and at drive through test areas a paltry 34% of the purported capacity available. The consequences?\u0026nbsp; In the last week of June, only 23,350 of Scotland’s 50,000 strong care home workforce received the routine test they were promised by the Scottish Government. According to the National Records of Scotland, 46% of the 4,173 deaths in Scotland, where COVID-19 is cited as the cause of death, occurred in a Scottish care home. I’m acutely aware of the pain and anguish of the bereaved as a I write this.\u0026nbsp; As someone with two close family members who are frontline workers within the care sector, this is about far more than politics to me.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Nicola Sturgeon does not have a monopoly on the emotional outpouring over what has happened during this pandemic, nor does she have the right to use the victims as a human shield to avoid scrutiny of how her failings contributed to the situation. It is the duty of opposition political parties to hold her government to account, because through a strong opposition comes stronger government, and a stronger nationwide response. Of course, whenever the media or opposition do challenge the First Minister about these facts, she deflects that \u0027England is worse\u0027, and moves on.\u0026nbsp; But hey, that’s due to the other pandemic Scotland is grappling with – Nationalism.

Due to constant TV exposure, the general public has a mostly positive view of Sturgeon’s handling of the crisis, and is favorably comparing Scotland’s perceived performance with that in England, despite similar infections and death rates.\u0026nbsp; However, Rober Kilgour, Executive Chairman of Renaissance Care, which operates 15 care homes in Scotland, and took in 87 patients from hospitals during the crisis, says Sturgeon’s performance has been ‘style over substance.’ ‘She’s absolutely loved being there on screen every lunch time. ‘This is not about politics’,\u0026nbsp; she keeps on saying. Whereas, it’s totally about politics for her, as far as she’s concerned. It should be about people first, not politics. It’s very much been politics first and people second.’ ‘There’s a real disconnect between what’s said from the podium, whether that’s on PPE, testing, funding or hospital discharges, and what’s actually experienced at the front line.’ He says that, despite claims by Sturgeon, Renaissance received only one delivery of one week’s supply of PPE from the Scottish government to each of their care homes -- after dealing with ten different local authority claim form procedures\u0026nbsp; -- and that there was a ‘postcode lottery’ for testing care staff. ‘When we finally did get mobile Army unit testing for our care homes, we found that 7.5% of our staff, who had no symptoms, were testing positive, and over 10.5% of residents, with no symptoms, were testing positive. And when that was raised by journalists, Nicola Sturgeon said that she had been told ‘somebody that has no symptoms is much less infectious’ (which is false). ‘On PPE, testing and funding, they were very good at blaming everyone else’. Rating her performance ‘five out of ten’ he says ‘a big concern I have is are they prepared to learn very quick lessons on what went wrong, what could have been done better? And who did the wrong thing at the wrong time?’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrYQujo8uvY Hugh Pennington, of The University of Aberdeen agrees with Kilgour’s five-out-of-ten assessment. He specifically notes that Scotland’s Health Service, which is fully devolved, could have made its own decisions at every stage to lockdown earlier, yet did not use those powers.\u0026nbsp; ‘The mistakes we made in Scotland have been a very slow start in testing. They haven’t really ramped up testing to the degree they could have done. We really didn’t know what was going on.’ Noting that most of the virus was imported from Europe in February and March, he says, ‘By the time we knew we had the virus, it was almost too late. Community transmission was already under way. And as a consequence of that the virus got out into the community, and in particular, we’ve done very poorly in Scotland protecting residents in care homes.’ Speaking on the Nike outbreak in March, which was covered up by the Scottish Government, Pennington says that a report has still not been issued.\u0026nbsp; ‘Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to know exactly what happened, because a report hasn’t been published. When you’ve got an outbreak, that’s a fantastic opportunity to learn. Unless you publish the data, you can’t learn anything from it. In Scotland we just haven’t had that data at all. Many other countries have done this, and it’s something that’s going to get in the way of us being prepared (for a second wave). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTSenqrpe1w Pennington further adds that Scottish Independence would not have made any difference to the scientific response, and may have hindered it, due to a disconnect from resources, such as testing laboratories, that are currently shared across the UK. However, Kilgour says that it would have been impossible for Scotland to cope financially with the crisis.\u0026nbsp; ‘Being part of the UK has been absolutely essential to the Scottish economy. Where would the Scottish government have got the money for all the schemes that the Chancellor has put in place to support business across all sectors. It’s not just that, coming out of lockdown and over the next few years, Scottish jobs, business and investment, are going to really benefit from being\u0026nbsp; part of the UK.’ The Scottish Government is very good at taking money from Westminster, and putting a kilt or a saltire on it, and presenting it as their scheme. \u0027They could have shut down earlier. They didn’t, and perhaps they will admit at some point, that that was a mistake, but from a funding and financial point of view I just don’t understand where this money was going to come from in an independent Scotland. It’s fantasy land.’ Watch the full video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dwlfDB7htk Help us fight back If you can, please help us get more of these articles out to more people, by pledging a\u0026nbsp;monthly donation.

The Sun pulled an article about the Health Secretary’s complacency…during a pandemic Despite being months into the Coronavirus pandemic crisis, when frontline workers are still not being routinely tested and PPE shortages are still troubling, the Scottish Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, had time in her schedule to tweet she would chase up ASDA for Nationalist journalist Angela Haggerty’s groceries. This, rightly, attracted much scorn and derision. The Sun ran a perfectly legitimate article, which they then deleted, leaving little trace that this story ever existed - an airbrush job the Ministry of Truth would be proud of. The only traces this ever happened are a blog post and some badly Photoshopped memes of Jeane standing in front of a podium with ASDA branding on it.\u0026nbsp; If that wasn’t enough, The Herald was ‘encouraged’ to change a headline the SNP took objection to, altering ‘Care home staff blamed for Scotland’s deadly wave of infections’ to ‘Staff are primary route for deadly virus into Scotland’s care homes’ – because they didn’t like how the paper reported the news. For Jeane Freeman, her PPE is ‘a Poison Pen Epistle’ drafted to a newspaper editor, then ‘Whoops!’ is slapped on the story - just like a supermarket yellow-label - discounting something that’s deemed past its best. #4. Sarah Smith dogpiled for saying Nicola Sturgeon \u0027Enjoyed\u0027 powers over lockdown Her crime: inadvertently telling the truth? BBC journalist, Sarah Smith, received a nippy response from the First Minister because she objected to the line “It has been obvious that Nicola Sturgeon has enjoyed the opportunity to set her own lockdown rules and not have to follow what is happening in England and other parts of the UK.” Always quick to take offence, Nicola said she never “enjoyed” anything less, after which Smith apologised. Then she apologised again. Then again, even more grovelling than apology #1 and apology #2.\u0026nbsp; Still not enough to pacify bullying Cybernats, of course, having smelled blood like a famished piranha. Ian Murray MP pointed towards “a cultish mob of silencers” that “paralyse criticisms of Sturgeon”. A fair comment, but I’ll simply point to the Google Dictionary: Enjoy - /ɪnˈdʒɔɪ,ɛnˈdʒɔɪ/ - 2. possess and benefit from eg: The Nationalists enjoy powers of veto over any news article which portrays them in a negative light #3. Here’s to you Mr Robinson Sorry, social justice warriors - the Nationalists invented ‘Cancel Culture’ well before you. ‘The BBC’s political editor during the Indyref era, Nick Robinson, compared protests against his fair and balanced coverage of the independence referendum to the treatment of media in Vladimir Putin’s Russia’, reported The Guardian. The crime Mr Robinson committed? -- raising the Royal Bank of Scotland’s contingency plans to relocate its HQ to London in the event of a vote for separation and questioning Alex Salmond on what impact this would have on the economy if Scotland voted Yes. In a classic move, Salmond didn’t answer the question and turned focus onto Robinson’s reporting. Result, a mob of flag-wavers outside the BBC’s offices in Pacific Quay. Robinson himself hit out at “intimidation and bullying” (there’s that word again – bullying).\u0026nbsp; Is there any other country in the liberal, democratic, Western world where a journalist can be hounded by a baying mob outside their place of work because they don’t like you doing your job properly. Welcome to Nationalist Scotland. #2. Made the Beeb launch a new channel which has (almost) ZERO viewers BBC Scotland\u0027s prime news show promotes its viewer count Here at The Majority, after two weeks of existence, our readership is already double the number of viewers of the BBC’s new Scotland channel, with their prime output The Nine. Named after the time it goes out at, not the number of people who tune in – that’s actually a little more at 5,000 (lost) souls. Nicola Sturgeon herself called for a radical reform of the BBC back in 2015, and the creation of a new, dedicated Scotland-only channel, which, ostensibly, nobody wanted, except those with a political agenda. The channel cost £32m to set up, which could have been easily ploughed into good quality, homegrown content and, of course, BBC 1 Scotland’s current Reporting Scotland news output, but that would not be on-message enough for the Nationalists (I refer you to the previous point). Journalism professor and former BBC editor, Tim Luckhurst, told the Scottish Daily Mail: The figures are deplorable, but they simply confirm the central flaw in the entire project; there was never a shred of audience demand for it. It was launched in a forlorn attempt to please the SNP, a classic example of why the BBC should never bow to political bullying. Indeed. #1.\u0026nbsp; When STV said \u0027No\u0027 to top journalist and commentator Stephen Daisley Nationalism attracts bullies Nobody knows fully what Pete Wishart \u0026amp; John Nicolson said to STV executives (Nicolson was a member of Westminster’s Culture, Media \u0026amp; Sport Committee at the time), but not long after, Stephen Daisley – one of Scotland’s foremost political commentators, a man for whom a pen is not merely mightier than the sword but Excalibur itself – was demoted as editor-at-large of their digital output; told he could only editing the page, or write for it, but not both. He resigned shortly after. Think on that for a minute. The government of the day influenced a national broadcaster to take an internal decision on one of their rising stars because they didn’t like how he reported news. Whatever happened to the Freedom of Press in this country? Presumably, the field in Scotland is so small, journalists and execs will do whatever it takes for a quiet life, because there aren’t many other employment prospects in Scottish broadcasting.\u0026nbsp; Nobody can say it better than the man himself: SNP tried to silence me. And their freedom to bully, vilify and malign is a chilling glimpse of one-party Scotland. Help us fight back In less than a year there\u0027s going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nationalists will use it to sow further division and continue to agitate for a disastrous referendum.

It allows us to be ever more informed about the world around us, which is undeniably a good thing; but the media is a voracious beast that must be filled with constant opinion pieces, rehashed endlessly with never-ending arguments. This is undoubtedly the case in Scotland, where the Separation question is perpetually discussed in articles which have become repetitive in the extreme and serve little more than justifying the wage of the writer. After a decade of argument, surely everything that can be written has been written on the subject. And yes, before you mention it, I understand the irony of using an opinion piece on secession to comment on other opinion pieces on secession.\u0026nbsp; The truth is that it’s in no party\u0027s interest to hold a second referendum. The SNP, with every advantage stacked in their favour, failed to get a majority and have failed to reliably get over 45% of the electorate to support them in polling. Support for secession is declining to where ‘No’ now has a consistent lead. The clock has rewound back to where we were after 2014.\u0026nbsp; Furthermore, the SNP knows that winning a second vote would be a first in history; Quebec, Puerto Rico, and New Caledonia all attest that if you lose the first secession vote, you are doomed to lose the next. After seven years of post-referendum polling and research, the SNP has yet to develop a set of arguments, or grievances, that appeal to a majority. If they have not been able to do it with all the odds stacked in their favour, they are unlikely ever to be able to.\u0026nbsp; For the pro-UK parties, there is even less incentive to run another vote. Firstly, why take the risk in the first place? Secondly, due to the conduct of the SNP after 2014, no one doubts that even if they lose the next one, they will immediately be campaigning for a third, then a fourth, ad nauseam. The trust that 2014 was going to solve the matter once and for all has been lost and with it the cooperation of a very large segment of the population.\u0026nbsp; Of course, it serves the SNP to make it look like they want a vote even if they have taken no steps to address the issues that cost them the first time. This distracts voters from their ever-increasing scandals and ever-worsening domestic record. Like a weary clown, there is only a finite number of balls they can keep juggling before it all comes crashing down. Talking about a referendum is only meant to distract while they try to keep their precarious balance. So, we are in a limbo, where thousands of articles are written on a topic no one has any interest in pursuing. Hypotheticals, that are doomed to remain hypotheticals, will be discussed and debated, arguments made and rebutted in abstract and sermons will be preached to choirs all across the country. It is as repetitive as it is futile.\u0026nbsp; If secession were ever going to happen, it would have happened in 2014 with a vast majority. For example, take Rhodesia in its 1969 constitutional referendum, one of the few colonies that had a formal referendum: over 81% voted to declare independence. Rhodesia is, of course, an appalling comparison to Scotland, not only were they a colony and not, as Scotland was, a coloniser, they already had their own currency, social services, taxation and banking system and military as well as being thousands of miles away from the UK.\u0026nbsp; Also, before you start to think of demographic shifts swinging the vote, remember that the average age in Scotland is 42 and increasing. The majority of my generation, who grew up in the summers of free love in the 1960s, now oppose secession and lean conservative. Adult responsibilities, like mortgages, jobs and pensions loom large. The fact that secession did not win by a vast majority in 2014, even with all the odds in the SNP\u0027s favour, dooms it like all the other failed secessionist attempts. The media may make hay from it, but all the articles, opinion pieces, debates are not the build-up to a future vote; they’re just the aftershocks of 2014 and they\u0027re fading away.

When the undecideds are excluded, the polling for either side is within the margin of error of each other (about 3% in a poll of 1000 people). This is essentially where we were right before the vote in 2014, when the vast majority of undecided voters voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. It is my firm belief that if a poll were to be held tomorrow, we would see very similar results to what we saw in 2014, especially as the SNP and their allies have not provided any satisfactory answers to the fundamental issues of\u0026nbsp; currency, hard border, and Europe that saw them lose last time. The SNP know these issues won’t bear much scrutiny. Even within their camp, few want to blow their final shot on another vote within the next few years. A free months ago, the highest polling, with undecideds excluded, indicated 55% of respondents wanted Scotland to break away from the UK; this was a product of multiple factors such as a perception of competence by Nicola Sturgeon; a looming no-deal Brexit; and an unpopular government in London led by bumbling Boris Johnson. The SNP were banking on a further exacerbation of those factors leading them to an ultimate victory. But that’s no longer the case. Firstly, the unfounded perception of Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s competence and the SNP has been holed below the waterline. The deaths in care homes, the slow initial vaccine rollout, mass testing issues and the failure to distribute relief funds have taken their toll on her reputation. There’s a lingering bad taste from shoddy and secretive performances at the Holyrood Inquiry. As Sturgeon’s cult of personality wanes, the SNP’s record in government is now under increasing scrutiny. It’s plain for all to see that after 14 years of the nationalists in power, we are high on all the lists you should be low on and low on all the lists you should be high on. Only this week, the SNP failed to meet their \"sacred duty\" of closing the attainment gap in education, not to mention housing, poverty, drug misuse, the environment etc. The shine has worn off the Teflon coating.\u0026nbsp; Add to that a shark, in the form of Alex Salmond, coming in the hole: bringing an ever-more vicious civil war within the nationalist camp. But even this is only one element of a larger picture that shows their perilous polling position. The biggest of these is that the SNP can no longer get any mileage out of Brexit, which the public have largely forgotten about. The SNP had bet against Brexit, but the chaos they had hoped for never came to pass.\u0026nbsp; For most voters it’s difficult to see the direct impact of the transition period. Bulk buying before the transition, panic buying at the start of the new lockdown, reduced continental and global demand for exported goods, border closures by France and massively decreased global travel and trade have all combined to obscure Brexit’s impact.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Meanwhile, the global pandemic has pushed Brexit off the stage. It was lockdown, not Brexit that saw panic buying and fights for toilet paper. Most Brexit supply issues were dealt with a lot faster than expected, and as a result, the transition period was mostly uneventful. Uneventful is not a good word for those who live by grievance. Combined with the embarrassing actions of the EU over the last few months regarding vaccine supply, Brexit did not deliver the killer blow to the Union that the SNP had hoped for. In fact, since the vaccine rollout, increasing numbers of people are having second thoughts about the EU altogether.\u0026nbsp; When Boris Johnson and his government could get nothing right, it drove up support for secession. But, like him or loathe him, that is no longer the case. The vaccine rollout and the EU\u0027s actions have bolstered the UK Government and Boris’ standing, and the gradual easing of the lockdown in England is increasing his support. In our headline-news driven era, old news is quickly forgotten. Now Boris Johnson is riding high on achievement. Promises of twice-weekly free COVID tests have many people here in Scotland envious, while the SNP-led Scotttish government continues to fall behind on testing and sees larger outbreaks of COVID compared to other parts of the UK.\u0026nbsp; I believe that many in the SNP were secretly hoping for a total failure of the vaccine rollout to create twisted political mileage, regardless of the lives it would have cost. Can you imagine the outrage that would have occurred had the UK and the EU been in reversed positions?\u0026nbsp; The SNP’s Lords of Chaos have lost their bets. They wanted disaster, but it didn’t come. Now they are exposed as chancers and are losing support. As the election campaign and their civil war progress, there will be further losses as the party and its leadership are increasingly seen as damaged goods.\u0026nbsp; Take note: At the UK\u0027s darkest hour in generations, under one of the most divisive Prime Ministers in recent history, undertaking one of the most divisive policies in decades and with their most \"popular\" leader ever, the SNP could only poll 55% (not including undecideds) in support of their primary objective.\u0026nbsp; They are far more fragile than they would want you to believe. \u0026nbsp; Angus Robinson is a lecturer at a UK university.

The chances are that you don’t; even people who live in Galloway have probably never been there, unless they have a passion for sea birds, or lighthouses. I can recommend it for these two things, plus the seascape, but mainly as a way of exploring one’s inner sense of Britishness. There, standing on the southern-most tip of Scotland, gazing across an empty Irish Sea, once the nexus of trade in these islands for early Britons, you get the sense that, having travelled miles to be somewhere really isolated, you have actually located the centre point of the United Kingdom. You look down the West Coast of Cumbria and think that you see Snowdonia in the distance. The Isle of Man is in sharp relief in the foreground and over your right shoulder you see Ulster, and suddenly you get it. All those fragments of history about long lost Gaels and Celts start to make sense and their swirling migrations and invasions become real and the fake history peddled by separatists, of a pure Scottish volk, living in a homogeneous nation with a shared heritage, seems all the more absurd. Here in Galloway, the only Scottish history that is shared with someone from Glasgow or Inverness is of the war-torn centuries between 1235, when the brutal ‘pacification’ of Galloway eradicated its culture along with most of its menfolk and subsumed this formerly autonomous principality into the Scottish state, and 1707 when access to the UK’s internal market relieved it of grinding poverty and set off a boom still reflected in the Georgian architecture of its mansions and market towns. Those four and a half centuries, when Scotland was what the historian Niall Ferguson memorably described as a \u0027failed state\u0027, saw the region fought over by Norman hoodlums, like Robert the Bruce, and brutally treated by a centralising, authoritarian Scottish state. The barbarism of the persecution of the Covenanters, and the Wigtown martyrs in particular, was its grisly low point. So much for the history; but now, when we contemplate another paradigm shift in our governance, what should Galloway do? The democratic will of the Gallovidians was clearly expressed in 2014 when nearly two thirds of us voted to stay in the United Kingdom. It is evident daily that we are being dragged down by a First Minister in Holyrood who seems hell-bent on destroying our main industry, tourism, by closing the border to pander to Anglophobic forces in her cult. What on earth gives anyone the idea that we would wish to be dragged out of the UK against our will and revert to being an unloved province of an unlovely authoritarian regime, if Scotland – that is to say mainly Glasgow and Dundee – voted for independence? If those medieval warlords of South West Scotland, Wallace, Bruce et al were alive today – and their descendants are still landowners in these parts – there is little doubt that they would not be campaigning to replace Queen Elizabeth II with Queen Nicola I. I suspect instead, they would be fighting to give Galloway independence from Scotland and striving to remain in a federal United Kingdom to maintain close links with the biggest customers for our beef. In the age of the internet and Bitcoin, we are, in any case, heading in a post-national direction. It may be that increasingly we will think about our government in the same way that we think about our electricity provider. Devolution was ostensibly about decentralising and returning power to the people. But it seems to have got hanked up in Holyrood, where the political class no more reflects the views of people in Galloway than the one in Westminster – probably rather less so. If small really is beautiful, we should look to our cousins in the Isle of Man for inspiration. You never hear a Manxman complaining about his lot (I should know, I shared the turret of a tank with one for a year). There is no reason why a portion of the Barnett Formula could not be paid to a small regional executive in Dumfries to keep public services going. We could be British, Gallovidian and yes, at Calcutta Cup matches, Scottish. It couldn’t be any worse than the state we are in.

Many of these supposed “examples” reference the nations which were established after the collapse of the USSR between 1989 and 1992. A period of turmoil, economic collapse, uncertainty and even bloody warfare in many parts of the former union, the scars of which are still keenly felt in places such as Armenia, Azerbaijan or Tajikistan. Nationalists like to use these countries as examples of how a newly independent country could quickly establish a currency. For example, on June 20th, 1992, Estonia moved to the Kroon, replacing the Soviet Ruble in a matter of months. However, when the specific circumstances of this move are considered, it becomes apparent just how outlandish this comparison is.\u0026nbsp; In 1992, the Soviet Union was in free fall; its currency was worthless, the printing presses were in full flow, hyperinflation was rampant and the political system that issued it was dying a very public death. The final nail in the coffin for the Soviet Ruble was when the Russian Federation established the Russian Ruble in 1992. Countries using the Soviet Ruble had no choice but to adopt a new currency as the old one was no longer issued by any nation of the\u0026nbsp;former Soviet Union.\u0026nbsp; Unlike the Ruble, the pound, however, is, and will continue to be, a global reserve currency after Separation. It is currently at a two year high against the US dollar. It\u0027s a foolish comparison. It’s deeply bewildering that those advocating for Scotland to separate from the United Kingdom would focus on the collapse of the USSR as an example of how newly independent nations should function. They clearly have no personal experience of what actually happened. When the USSR collapsed, so did its entire system of social welfare. Unemployment skyrocketed, education and healthcare crumbled, Quality of life plummeted as the lines at shops and pension boards grew longer and longer. It took decades to heal. Many places throughout the former USSR have still not healed.\u0026nbsp; I ask you all, especially the Separatists who are so keen to use these countries as an example, to think through what exactly they’re arguing for. In the UK, we benefit from a comprehensive welfare state, which is by no means perfect, but which provides access to free world-class healthcare. We have shops that are stocked with innumerable goods. Our police and security forces are well funded, or at least have the provision for funding, despite the SNP’s disastrous management. They don\u0027t have to sell weapons and equipment on the black market to make ends meet. The SNP have mismanaged virtually everything in Scotland, but we are nowhere near the levels of deprivation the countries of the former USSR had to endure in the early years of their independence. Although, if we lose the fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK, we might.\u0026nbsp; Separatists always want to sell us a rosy vision of the future where the money is free, and all the ills of the world are banished south of the border to the ‘damned English’. But if they want to sell us that dream they need to come up with a better example, a better vision of our future, than one styled after Tajikistan in 1992.\u0026nbsp; I have seen that vision in real life, and I can tell you it’s not something you should ever aspire to.","date":"2020-12-27","summary":"For those who, unfortunately, spend their time trawling through the endless toxic abuse and conspiracy theories that make up secessionist Twitter, you..."},{"title":"Galloway: Salmond’s fat arse, Bun fights at the OK Corral, and The Mother of All Scandals","url":"/articles/galloway-salmonds-fat-arse-bun-fights-at-the-ok-corral-and-the-mother-of-all-scandals/","content":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcIPr3AOGhQ In his weekly broadcast, George Galloway, leader of the fledgling Alliance For Unity Party, covers many of the issues in Scottish politics today. We have transcribed the best parts for you. #1 Significant Labour figure to join Alliance For Unity We are building a stable of parliamentary candidates that are really thoroughbreds and I can\u0027t tell you who right now, but I have been talking for the last day or two to a very prominent twice Labour party parliamentary candidate about joining us on the lists for the Holyrood elections in May. A significant Labour figure together with myself, a long-time Labour Member of Parliament, the youngest ever chairman of the Labour Party in Scotland. #2 We’re not in it for the beer Neither am I in it for the wages. Trust me, being in Hollyrood would require a very, very substantial cut in my earnings. Neither am I in it for profile, as a few people insultingly said in the week. I have plenty of profile. I presented a\u0026nbsp;global television radio show last night to almost a million people live, right across the globe. I\u0027m on television seven days a week.\u0026nbsp; My fellow candidates are not in it for themselves either. We\u0027re there to fight for Scotland as part of the Union, Scotland as part of Britain, sharing the challenges and sharing the benefits that have accrued to our country over more than three centuries. We will never agree that the people of Newcastle or Liverpool or Manchester or Birmingham or the Southwest or South Wales, that these people are somehow foreign to us. #3 Write better hate mail One of the consequences of this ‘neverendum’, this poisonous nationalist discourse which runs through every part of Scottish life now, is that for nationalists, at least in the media echo chamber, guttural feral language substituted for speaking in the proper English for which we were once famous, has become the norm certainly on social media.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; I receive sometimes hundreds of hate mail on Twitter and on Facebook and on email even -\u0026nbsp; really vicious stuff. But leaving aside the viciousness, the most extraordinary thing about it is the low cultural and educational level that it betrays.\u0026nbsp; Hardly any of the hate mail I get is written in proper English. It\u0027s not even written in proper Scots. It is ill-written, illiterate, vile, foul and I cannot separate that from the degradation of Scottish public life that the SNP is responsible for. #4 Calls for Nicola Sturgeon resignation Good news is that the petition we launched demanding the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon as Scotland\u0027s First Minister has now raised past 30,000 signatures, in rapid quick time, and I want to encourage each and every one of you, if you have not already done so, both to sign it yourself, and to actively canvas others for their signature on this. There has never been a more powerful case for someone\u0027s resignation than there is for the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon. Not only is she presiding over cataclysmic failures right across the policy and administrative spectrum, but even in presiding over her own party, now fighting like ferrets in a sack over parliamentary nominations. #5 Nepotism in the SNP The course of nepotism in the SNP\u0026nbsp; seems to know no bounds. Even Hamza is putting up his now wife for a parliamentary candidate. There\u0027s gravy in the trough and they are all desperately trying to get their snouts into that trough and they don\u0027t care who knows it. They don\u0027t care which colleagues back they have to publicly stab, which rule they have to rig, which national executive committee they have to fix, in order to get this person in or keep that person out. It is a total bun fight at the OK Corral. #6 Nicola Sturgeon’s coronavirus lies Thousands of lives have been lost, and I call it a lie, that Scotland was on the verge of eliminating the coronavirus from our country. It was a lie that Scotland was doing three times, or was it five times better, than other parts of the United Kingdom. This was always false. It was a figure invented, and the truth concealed, just like the Nike conference truth was concealed. Just like the government\u0027s role in the sending of our grandmothers and our grandfathers to die in the care home carnage, for which the SNP bear absolute responsibility. We know the truth that the authorities in the care homes and in the NHS were acting on ministerial orders -\u0026nbsp; on Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s government\u0027s orders. #7 The SNP has let down our young people On top of the disaster of the care homes, we now have thousands of students who should never have been asked to come back, and who were not tested, not tracked or traced, because that capacity does not exist, despite all the money that has been spent on it. And now some of them are breaking out like inmates of a prison camp, are now incarcerated in little boxes for which they are paying through the nose.\u0026nbsp; The SNP are now scurrying to deal with the second scandal in a row involving our young people. The first being the complete farce of the exam results. One scandal comes past so fast, followed by another, it’s actually difficult to keep track of them. #8 Why has Glasgow been treated differently from Aberdeen? Glasgow was not treated like Aberdeen because the SNP cannot face the wrath of the SNP support in Glasgow turning away from them - tens of thousands of votes in the city of Glasgow, so they gambled it would not get markedly worse, but disastrously worse it has gotten. #9 Constant SNP scandals It’s one scandal after another: The scandal of Derek Mackay, still picking up thousands of pounds a month for a job he hasn’t done in six months. No sick note, no attendance at work, just trousering the money and doing God knows what. The Jean Freeman scandal, the John Swinney scandal. #10 Alex Salmond ‘lynching’ Alex Salmond is a far more formidable political adversary than Nicola Sturgeon. She is not of Alex Salmond’s capabilities, his standing in politics, in the country and beyond it. I spent decades in parliament with Alex Salmond. I know his capacity.\u0026nbsp; I ought to be delighted that his gas is at a very low peep these days, but I (am) indignant to any injustice, and I have taken a very close interest in the attempted lynching of Alex Salmond. I said that Alex Salmond was being set up right from the start and I said that he would be acquitted.\u0026nbsp; And I say now, that the scandal of the setting up of Alex Salmond is matched only by the utter disgrace of the so-called committee of inquiry. Nicola Sturgeon promised full cooperation with that inquiry, but there has been endless obfuscation and obstruction instead. #11 Nicola, Peter and Alex ménage à trois Any government in the world would be brought down by a conspiracy of leading figures in the governing party, a conspiracy so brazenly exemplified by Peter Murrell’s WhatsApp messages in the hands of every journalist in Scotland now and in the hands of the police and the Crown Office, (who are) taking their time dealing with it. The chief executive and the leader and the first minister all in the same bed. That’s quite a double bed! That’s quite a ménage à trois! Of course they don’t talk to each other! Murrell didn’t even know why Alex Salmond’s fat arse was on his sofa in his own house on a Saturday night!\u0026nbsp; A conspiracy involving leading figures in a governing party to send their former leader and icon to prison for the rest of his life? Boy, that’s a scandal, a drama. But, what’s happening about it? Who’s being held accountable?\u0026nbsp; #12 Promise to open the books This is the Mother of All Scandals, and if I’m elected to the Scottish Parliament, I will go through this like a dose of salts. So, don’t bother shredding, because I’ll have the best forensic investigators going through each and every one of your\u0026nbsp; hard drives. We will open the books at Hollyrood, even the dirty ones. We will get to the bottom of what I firmly believe, is not just a low grade nationalist administration bent on the destruction of our country, bent on destroying something that took 300 years to build. It’s not just a collection of clowns’ incompetence, not fit to go out for a loaf. It\u0027s not just that it\u0027s corruption: It\u0027s potential crime. It\u0027s political, and maybe legal, corruption that we are talking about here. It\u0027s always the cover-up that does them in. #13 A few words for English liberals One of the most maddening things about this period is the lionization of this incompetent nationalist, separatist and corrupt administration by liberals and lefties in London and England and elsewhere. Their hatred of Brexit and Boris Johnson is such that they are prepared to assist the destruction and partition of our country, just because they hate Brexit and hate Boris Johnson. It shows the transitory nature of majorities in Westminster. It’s not a good enough reason to partition your country and break it up forever.\u0026nbsp; I’m still waiting for your endorsement of the turbulent scenes in Belgium today. Take a close look at them. That’s what Nationalism looks like. I’m going to ask you - how come you’re prepared to support Scottish nationalism and you wouldn’t touch Flemish nationalism with a barge pole?

And the man who is going to apologise for it , sits in Nicola Sturgeon’s cabinet.This concentration of power in Scotland —\u0026nbsp; of a minority SNP government, a single police force, and with the Lord Advocate sitting in the government — is the hallmark of a banana republic. But even in a banana republic you wouldn’t be burning money at quite the rate the Sturgeon administration is doing.\u0026nbsp;This figure knocks into a cocked hat the £750,000 or so — and counting — that the government have had to pay for the framing of Alex Salmond.I\u0027m not shy about putting it that way: The SNP framed their former leader Alex Salmond. Now, I\u0027m against Alex Salmond, as I am against Nicola Sturgeon, though there\u0027s no doubt in my mind that one is considerably more qualified as a political leader than the other.But, I\u0027m for justice no matter who it\u0027s for, no matter who it\u0027s against. And Alex Salmond was the victim of a conspiracy; a conspiracy that might well have put him in prison for the rest of his life. Going into prison, in his shape, at the age of 66, he might never have come out.This attempted assasination is now being unmasked at such a rate that the SNP leadership simply cannot staunch the flow of new information, new evidence, new whistleblowers coming forward all the time.I myself am in possession of knowledge, which I cannot publicly impart for legal reasons. There are only two safe places to talk about some of these things; one of them is under parliamentary privilege and the other is under courtroom privilege.\u0026nbsp;There\u0027s another important court case, about to begin, in relation to the Nicola Sturgeon administration, and there, I\u0027m sure, the legal privilege of evidence given in a court of law, will be fully exercised.As this week was the two sworn affidavits of the Hon. Craig Murray, a former British ambassador, in which, inter alia, he made the most serious accusations of serious criminal behaviour on the part of the leadership of the SNP and the Scottish Government.And not one square centimeter of any newspaper or any news bulletin on radio or television carried this information, which was fully privileged, could have been quoted safely, absolutely in full. Instead a \u0027cross-dressing squirrel\u0027 was released, with Nicola Sturgeon making an oh-so-achingly politically-correct statement about trans people in Scotland. https://twitter.com/NicolaSturgeon/status/1354521063502336001 Now I don\u0027t know how many trans people there are in Scotland. Vanishingly few I expect. Nonetheless, I absolutely oppose any bigotry or discrimination or hatred against any section of the community. But Nicola\u0027s \u0027cross-dressing squirrel\u0027 statement was blanket coverage on all news bulletins and in every single newspaper. On the day that they could have reported, even a centimetre, of a former British ambassador\u0027s claim, under legal privilege, in the court in EdinburghAnd you need to ask yourself if this is not further evidence of this concentration of power. This banana republic concentration of power, of which I speak.The Government, a single police force, the Lord Advocate in the cabinet room, a Crown Office maliciously prosecuting people, and a Scottish media, unwilling, except with honourable exceptions, even to report on these matters.If that is not a cause for alarm, at a time when people are openly discussing using automatic weapons, under the saltire, under the rubric of Scottish Nationalism. https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1354882469175185411 If you\u0027re not alarmed by that, then I don\u0027t know. Maybe my nerves are getting the better of me. I am extremely alarmed that I have brought my family back to live in a country that is being misgoverned like that.Now Craig Murray\u0027s accusations are easily found on the internet . I cannot go through them for legal reasons. But the affidavits that he entered into the court are sworn testimony. If they are untrue then he has committed perjury. And if he\u0027s committed perjury, he must be charged with perjury. He has not been charged with perjury and I happen to believe that every word in his affidavits is true. And you will have to look for yourself; and you will have to look for yourself, because you certainly won\u0027t find it anywhere on the Scottish media.When the next court case of which I speak comes along, that will be standing in the name of a rather more powerful individual than Craig Murray. But I still wouldn\u0027t put money on any coverage in what passes for the Scottish media, when that court case comes along, which is, in any case, imminent.So we\u0027re living in very dangerous and quite dark times...

In that time, he has formed a new party @Alliance4Unity, which has gained over 7400 Twitter followers in a week, and received over 1800 letters from would-be candidates (which he says he is having some difficulty processing). Today, he appeared live on YouTube and Twitter\u0026nbsp;to discuss his views and his new party, citing three main reasons he opposes Separation. #1 It’s not Socialism Galloway frames the issue as a modern-day Battle of Britain, which he reminds viewers, was fought by people from all over the UK, with no care of their hometown or country, while SNP founders were ‘actively intriguing and collaborating with the agents of Hitler.’\u0026nbsp; And while he clarifies that the current SNP is not fascist, he says it has always been obvious to him that the SNP are ‘small-minded, vindictive rogues, living on grudge’. In his typical bombastic style, Galloway is scathing of his former socialist colleagues, who, he believes, have traded their principles for shallow Nationalism.\u0026nbsp; ‘I’m just saying what everyone who used to be a Socialist used to say. It is you who has changed, not me...Nobody who called themselves a Socialist would ever support breaking up countries. How would that be in the interests of the workers? Nationalism is the Socialism of fools.’ ‘The idea that Separation equals Socialism is the opposite of the truth. Were it to be successful, Scotland becoming a cut-price bargain basement to the remaining English and Welsh economy. It would be a race to the bottom’. Drawing parallels to his support for Brexit, Galloways says that Separation would result in less independence. Scotland would be ‘a dot’ among powerful members who would dictate financial terms to reduce Scotland’s deficit from 9% to 3%. Noting the case of another small country, Greece, which was forced by the European Central Bank to follow austerity-max financial rules ‘causing Greek children to go hungry’. #2 It’s economic insanity Secondly, he scorns the economic arguments for Separation, citing his response to a caller on his talk show. https://twitter.com/georgegalloway/status/1281468393900646400 ‘If Scotland were to leave the UK, the Barnett Formula automatically ends. What currency does it intend to use? Some of you may have seen the encounter on the Mother Of All Talk Shows with Paul. In perfect form, it crystallizes the level of economic ignorance of your average Scottish Nationalist. Paul not only believes that the Bank of England...would not only allow a breakaway, Separatist, Scotland, to use its currency, but also that it would allow Scotland to use it for Quantitative Easing!’ ‘You may say it’s a shame to pick on wee Paul. Maybe he\u0027s a wee boy, or a finance minister in the Scottish Parliament, for all I know. Is there anyone outside Broadmoor or Carstairs, who really believes that the British would stand by and let their currency be cheapend by allowing somebody in Edinburgh to start printing pounds? This is such economic lunacy. It\u0027s impossibe to believe. But, there are many Scottish Nationalists who do.’ ‘Scotland would have no central bank, it would have no currency of its own. It would have no-one to stand behind its currency and debts. And it could only join the Euro by cutting two thirds of its deficit. Meaning absolute destruction of the Scottish economy. Absolute penury. Widepread poverty. Absolute wreckage of the public sector in Scotland’. #3 There will be a hard border His third point is that, despite Nationalist claims, Scotland would have ‘the very hardest of borders’ with England, which would cause damage to cross-border trade, tourism, and most fundamentally, to human relations.\u0026nbsp; ‘To the people on either side of that hard border, who have lived without one for 300 years, and have intermarried across this border for centuries. The creation of a border, when over 60% of Scotland\u0027s exports with England, its main trading partner: the damage would be savage.’ ‘The overwhelmingly likely outcome would be a bitter disappointment amongst the Scottish people about the consequences about the breakup, about the failure to deliver on the promises that the Separatists make; that Scotland would be some kind of milk and social democratic honey. This would curdle into bitterness, grudge and perhaps worse.’ ‘After all, who do you think the SNP would blame? The last people to be blamed would be themselves. The first people to be blamed would be the English. It’s ringing in my ears, as someone crossing that border: The English, the people of Liverpool, Newcastle, Manchester, of Leeds...When I cried over the demise of Jackie Charlton. Am I supposed to regard Jackie Charlton as a foreigner, to me? Are the people of Liverpool foreigners, to me? Are the people of Newcastle foreigners, to me? No. But to the SNP they are foreigners.’ ‘That is something I, and I hope, the majority of my fellow Scots will never accept.’ Galloway says his new party will contest list seats and will be the only alternative to one or other forms of Nationalism, whether it is ‘dressed up in the green clothes of its gardening section, The Scottish Green Party, or dressed up in the clothes of breakaway rival Nationalists groups, which may or may not be part of a plot to maximise the Nationalist vote.’\u0026nbsp; Despite his calls for unity to form a tactical voting alliance with the LibDem, Labour and Conservative parties, he says that there is no sign that the other parties will join him.

Two hundred and more Galloways stood on the slopes of The Merrick (2766 ft) to select their new chief after the ancient post lay vacant. The vote, by acclamation, was unanimous. Swathed in plaid, the victor – known hereafter as The Galloway – beamed benevolently in his lizard-green regalia after officials at the Court of Lord Lyon, King at Arms, confirmed his appointment. “Just call me George,” he joshed, batting away a back-slapping barrage of banter and bonhomie. Originally from Dundee, the red-blooded campaigner has roots in the Scottish borders, now the seat of intense political controversy. “I never wanted this,” he admits to Hello Magazine, spitting the syllables like tiresome tacks. The new chieftain is on the cusp of leading his ancient patrimony of out of Scotland altogether after the narrowly contested second independence referendum threatens to cut the Scottish Borders off from the rest of the United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp; “If we’re gonna have an international frontier, then it’s US – the PEOPLE who actually live here – who’ll decide where it goes, not THEM.” ‘Them’ refers to the Scottish National Party and the government up in Edinburgh, currently basking in the afterglow of their independence victory.\u0026nbsp; But now they’re hooked on their own petard: self-determination. The very beating heart – the ultimate pump-house of their founding principle – has been turned, like a tank turret, against them. For those in the know, it’s no surprise. The Scottish borders have long displayed a distinct spirit as local historian, Olivia Neil, explains. “We were a province of Northumbria in the 8th century and remained semi-independent until Alexander III invaded in 1249.” Outside Tesco’s, the press pack buzzes about the chieftain like midges round a wildebeest. George is in his element. “If we win, we’ll be the first clan based outside Scotland since the Viking, Magnus VI, sold off the Hebrides.” Historically speaking, the clocks won’t just rewind to 1266, but risk a full Dali-esque meltdown if the local self-determination referendum is passed. Like a child torn between divorcing parents, the Scottish borders are set to defy Edinburgh, splitting off to become a crown dependency of the United Kingdom, like its siblings in the Isle of Man or Jersey. Scotland’s First Minister is not taking it lightly, launching a love-bombing offensive from her ornate 18th century crash pad in Bute House:\u0026nbsp; “Losing a chunk of my country would be like cutting off the nose on my face,” she admits. But, sadly, if the polls are anything to go by, Scotland’s First Minister may need some emergency surgery on her patriotic proboscis.\u0026nbsp; Undeterred, she woos the waverers with a smile of beatific purity. “We love you, no matter how you vote,” she intones, leaning intently to camera. “Deep down, I know you know that.” But will the subtle, subliminal message cut through?\u0026nbsp; It’s certainly no’ for want of trying. The First Minister’s tiny white fists punch aloft as her ardour rises to a crescendo of upbeat negativity, unleashing a teeth-rattling battle-cry that pierces to the soul: “GO FOR NO!” Down in Dumfries, George is still handing out YES leaflets at a garden centre with a posse of hereditary bodyguards and attendant praise poet. “He’s really my press secretary, but we gave him a harp and a feather in his bonnet, and now he can sing for his supper.”\u0026nbsp; Passers-by are charmed. “They say the chief’s an old commie, but he doesn’t half look gorgeous with that dirk and sporran.” By evening, well-wishers have moved lochside to gather round a crackling bonfire for a rousing chorus of the jaunty clan jig: Hail to the Chief we have chosen for the region, Hail to the Chief! We salute him, one and all. Hail to the one we selected as commander, George has the aim, to make this county grander, Hail to the Galloway! Hail to the Chief!

At the time, I was amazed that there was no media that represented us, the silent majority of anti-Nationalists in Scotland. In four months, thanks to your support, The Majority has grown to over 8000 Twitter followers and 2500 Facebook fans, our articles have been read over 200,000 times and hundreds of thousands of you have watched our videos and memes. Some highlights: All Under One Braincell Would you like a foot rub too, Nicola? Nicola\u0027s Book Club We\u0027ve also been featured in the Dundee Courier and had mentions in The Times. But there’s still a lot more to do. Every year our opponents are pouring over a million pounds into The National and to Wings Over Scotland, promoting ugly Nationalist propaganda, grievance and lies.\u0026nbsp; Our newspapers are weak. They’re so scared of losing Nationalist readers, they hire columnists who always want to compromise. Let’s give the Separatists more concessions! Let’s try some new-fangled constitutional solution! But appeasing Separatists never works. The simple fact is the majority won the 2014 referendum, and winners don’t need to appease. We need our own media that will say no to indyref2, support anti-Nationalist politicians, and will push to end the tired and ugly Nationalism that has infected Scotland. I can do a lot more. Check my LinkedIn. I founded japantoday.com, one of the world’s largest news sites and had a staff of 40 people. I can build The Majority into a full anti-Nationalist media that can rival The National and reach the vast majority of ordinary Scots who are appalled at the state of our country. But I need your help to do it. Right now, thanks to our donors, we currently have £1000 pounds a month in recurring donations (actually £981.29). If I can get that up to £2500 pounds a month I can give up my other work and do this full time, as well as pay for running costs. As we get beyond that I can start to hire people and build a team that can turn the tide against the Nationalists. I know times are tough for many of you, but if you can, please pledge whatever you can afford. Even £6 or £10 a month — less than the price of a cup of coffee a week — can make a big difference. (If you are a corporate donor, I hope you can donate £100 or £50 a month, a tiny amount compared to the costs of business distruption that would happen in a disastrous Separation). Let’s get into a strong position by the end of the year, and head into the election with The Majority, amplifying all our voices.

The first setback was hearing the BBC describe Nicola Sturgeon being cleared by an ‘independent’ inquiry. The second was reading an op-ed in The Times by Alex Massie, the Spectator’s Scottish editor, describing the SNP as “exhausted but irreplaceable.” The riposte to the first has to be that if this was an inquiry into Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin, or almost anyone else, the BBC would not use the word ‘independent’ about an inquiry by an inquisitor carefully selected by the accused and limited by very delicately confined terms of reference before delivering a report that is at odds even with the leaked conclusions of the Kafkaesque Parliamentary Inquiry, which is then so heavily redacted as to be meaningless. The BBC has also repeatedly referred to Mr Hamilton as a QC, lending an air of respectability to what appears to have been a very grubby affair, when he is in fact an SC, from Ireland, with a reputation for clearing First Ministers of devolved assemblies of wrongdoing. You can look him up on Wikipedia, even if BBC journalists apparently can’t. Banana republics are most egregiously defined by the complicity of their state broadcasters and BBC Scotland is no exception. Sadly. The second is perhaps more worrying. If even a nominally unionist senior journalist believes that May’s Holyrood elections are such a shoo-in for the SNP that it is pointless for the Scottish Tories and Labour to fight on a manifesto of change, then it is time to start packing and follow the steadily growing convoy heading South. It begs the question, if now is not the time to replace the SNP, when even nationalists like Jim Sillars and Craig Murray (who was convicted of Contempt of Court today and now faces up to two years in prison) and the Rev Stu Campbell, of Wings Over Scotland, say they won’t vote for them, then when will it be? The gangrenous narrative that would accept another SNP led coalition at Holyrood, while London plays a long game and triumphs over separatism at some undefined point in the future, is deluded and a betrayal. https://twitter.com/CraigMurrayOrg/status/1373994208902647813 It is deluded because it would mean another five years of the SNP building its client state and of brainwashed young people exiting our schools and universities with a Braveheart education, so that eventually Scotland goes beyond the point of no return. And it is a betrayal of parents and patients and drug addicts and commuters and just about anyone outside the complacent Holyrood bubble. Happily, there are people who believe that the Scottish election is winnable. Not because we possess the rare psephological insights of the smooth metropolitan media elite, but because the alternative is unthinkable. Our names are George Galloway and Jamie Blackett and countless others from across the political spectrum who have come together to form the Alliance for Unity.

It is just one of many possible pasts or futures. Let me know what you think would have happened in the comments. On September 18, 2014, Scotland votes \u0027yes\u0027 to independence by 51%. Independence supporters claimed they wanted a more democratic system, but now 49% of the country is living under a system they don\u0027t want. Financial institutions immediately relocate to London. They cannot let their customers\u0027 assets be exposed to the uncertainty of a smaller market and\u0026nbsp;political risk. The rest of the UK refuses to join a currency union. English voters cannot allow their currency to be tied to the economy of a foreign country, especially one with socialist goals. Alex Salmond backs down from his threat to not pay Scotland\u0027s share of the UK\u0027s debt -- he knows that\u0027s financial suicide. Scotland tries to join the European Union, but productive German voters refuse -- they don\u0027t want to pay for another Greece. Unproductive countries like Spain and Greece also veto joining -- Scotland\u0027s entry would mean less handouts for them. Scottish leaders cut corporation tax in a bid to attract foreign investment. But the volatile currency, tiny market, and uncertain political climate cannot attract serious investment. Contrary to pre-independence predictions oil revenues do not exceed expenses. Power generated by renewables cannot be sold overseas and does not add to tax revenues. The government asks ex-pat Scots to come back and help bring investment to the country. They refuse because they did not get a vote in the referendum. Labour party supporters, who didn\u0027t vote for the new state, and appeared to align themselves with the Tories, are seen as traitors to Scotland, and to the socialist cause. The party is finished in Scotland. The SNP claim a mandate and, unrestricted, go to the far left. Ex-Labour supporters find themselves shut out of government jobs. Some switch allegiance, becoming even zealous nationalists to prove their allegiance. Many moderates move overseas. Without Scottish MPs Labour cannot gain a majority in England. Conservative governments are assured for a generation. English nationalism rises. To protect English jobs, the English say all Scots coming to England to work must have a work visa. The condition is that a Scot cannot take a job that any English person can do. Many Scots return home to unemployment, which increases the country\u0027s welfare costs. The Scots retaliate with a similar policy and many English workers have to leave Scotland. Families are broken up. To enforce the visa the English erect border controls on their side. The Scots can do nothing about this. Scots in England must show their papers at any time, and can be deported for minor offenses. Scots living and working in England are trapped. Many try to become English citizens to maintain their jobs, but England doesn\u0027t want any more foreigners. Suspicion and distrust rises. To protect English manufacturing, every truck coming though the border from Scotland faces extra inspection. The Scots complain, but can do nothing about it. Manufacturers relocate to England. More Scottish jobs are lost. England increases the production of shale oil and fracking. The worldwide oil glut brings the price of oil to record lows, compounded by new technology that leads to the widespread adoption of electric cars. With no manufacturing or financial services industry to tax, Scotland can no longer pay for its welfare state and ageing population, and spirals into debt. The Scottish Health Service grinds to a halt. The country cannot afford the latest treatments, technology, and staff. With no new doctors being trained, doctors are imported from third-world countries. It takes many months to see a specialist. Many people die in dirty hospitals while politicians and the well-connected go outside the country for treatment. To cover its deficit the government nationalizes the oil industry. The US and England respond with trade sanctions. The Whisky industry is destroyed. Scottish politicians look around for a ways to finance their debt. The International Monetary Fund will not help unless the country agrees to austerity measures. Not wanting to give up their benefits, which are a matter of pride and enshrined in the new written Constitution, the country votes to default on its international obligations. The Scottish pound is devalued. There is hyperinflation and a run on the banks. Many people begin to use the dollar, gold and Bitcoin as alternative currency. Imported goods such as cars, TVs, and electronics skyrocket in price. It is now too costly for most Scots to travel abroad. A black market in food starts. Like Greece and Argentina before them, there are riots as people see their life savings destroyed. The government responds by imposing restrictions on movement and association. Scots politicians, many of whom have been covertly paid by Russia since independence, lead the country into an alliance with Russia, the only country willing to lend. In exchange for loans, Russia demands access to Scotland\u0027s ports. Politicians sell this as an \"equal friendship between nations\". Russian warships are welcomed on the Clyde. The dreams of the \"Red Clydesiders\" are complete. Russian power is not only on the border with England; Russian nuclear submarines -- using the abandoned base in Faslane -- control The North Sea and North Atlantic. There is nothing England can do about this. Russia starts to covertly finance separatist groups in northern England. The CIA finance Scottish opposition groups, and civil unrest rises. The government nationalises any remaining industry and installs party faithful, who are generally incompetent, to manage those industries. Productivity slides. Government-owned TV stations and news outlets control opinion. The few remaining opposition media are routinely harassed, threatened and subject to sudden closure. The internet is censored. The Scottish Socialist Republic is declared. The flag is a yellow lion rampant surrounded by a red background. Scottish society splits into four groups: 1) The inner party: Political activists and businesspeople who are paid with oil money to keep the party line 2) Government workers and welfare recipients, who depend on the government for their income 3) Immigrants: who do what little work remains. Dissenters are denounced, imprisoned and their assets seized. Everyone else leaves. As the joke goes: What\u0027s the difference between Scotland and Venezuela? About five years.

They acknowledge the financial, social and political risks, the defence issues, the global and local problems - and to them, it is still worth it. They are willing to undergo all that may happen because they fundamentally believe their sacrifice is required for Scotland to break away from the United Kingdom. They do not hide away from the difficulties and do not attempt to conceal them, and in such, I have no problem with them. We are each entitled to our own opinions and beliefs, at least until Humza Yousaf’s hate speech law comes into force, and it is in no way my prerogative to deny them the expression of their honestly-held beliefs. But, I do have a problem with the vast majority of Nationalists, who through deceit, lack of understanding or even their own wilful blindness, attempt to conceal the myriad of difficulties that will occur in the decades after the break-up of the UK. They lie because they know their support would collapse if they honestly admitted to the issues, leaving only that very small minority of true believers. Perhaps they are lying to themselves as well? The deniers include those who reject the Scottish Government\u0027s own\u0026nbsp;GERS figures, despite the fact they supported them in 2014; those who claim that breaking apart the UK would somehow undo the damage caused by\u0026nbsp;Brexit, despite not caring about leaving the EU in 2014; those who claim currency issues would be solved by keeping an informal\u0026nbsp;currency union\u0026nbsp;with the rest of the UK; those who claim that since Scotland did so well during the COVID-19 pandemic (shocker, we didn\u0027t) that independence would be a walk in the park.\u0026nbsp; Add those who believe long-debunked and outlandish lies about secret oil fields, dark-money conspiracy theories, fifth columnists or that joining the EU without our own currency and monetary system is possible, and that the other countries,\u0026nbsp;who fear their own secessionist movements, would let us in straight away.\u0026nbsp; I have no issue with those who want to break up the UK regardless of the consequences, other than I disagree with them completely with all of my being. They are reckless with our shared futures and very narrow-minded. Still, I do not have ideological objections to them. They can believe whatever they like.\u0026nbsp; I do have fundamental ideological issues with the charlatans who intentionally lie about the constitutional debate and who use purposefully designed misinformation to further their nationalist objectives. As a recent article in The Herald said: the fight against the Nationalists is\u0026nbsp;not \"project fear\" but \"project fact\".\u0026nbsp; So, I challenge those who advocate for Separation, if these are genuinely your firmly held beliefs, be truthful about the consequences. Attempt to win the debate based on facts, not fictions and grievances. Support your causes without relying on attempting to fool enough of the electorate to believe you just long enough for them to check the box.\u0026nbsp; If you believe the future of Scotland is best served outside of the UK, prove it to us. Because if you don\u0027t prove it, and when the benefits stop, and the austerity sets in, I don\u0027t think those you conned will thank you. I think, instead, that you will find that Scotland will be even more divided than it is now. And, after decades of abuse and rejection, I doubt the rest of the UK and its people would be in any mood to help us. I challenge you to be honest in what you campaign for, and honest in how you present your cases. If you are honest, I will respect you as I would anyone else, and I will debate you with sincerity and civility.\u0026nbsp; However, if you are not honest, and you continue to lie, misdirect and evade in the vain hope of fooling us, we will oppose you and never respect you. In wanting us to take the plunge, all I want to know from you is: how deep is the water?

We won\u0027t tell our followers that we have no legal right to hold a referendum and never mention that it’s a matter reserved to the UK government. 4. We’ll tell them that it’s up to the UK Government to challenge the legality of our actions. Just like someone saying that burglary is not a crime, breaking into your house and then telling the judge it\u0027s legal because they said so. 5. We\u0027ll not mention that, because it’s illegal from the outset, local authorities, who control polling places, will reject holding it. And The Electoral Commission? Better not say anything about them either. 6. We\u0027ll talk about taking action when we have a majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament, despite currently having one with the Greens. That majority has asked for a referendum twice and been rejected. But we think, somehow, it\u0027ll be different this time. 7. We have no way to force the UK Government to give us a referendum. The Conservatives 80-seat majority and a manifesto pledge to maintain the UK is unimportant, as is that whole \u0027once-in-a-generation\u0027 thing. 8. If we had a majority of the 650 seats in the UK parliament, we could do what we like. But we only run candidates in Scotland, giving us a maximum of 59 seats, so we can’t do anything. We are stupid. 9. It’s only logical that Boris Johnson will give us a referendum that, according to our polls, he will lose. 10. Even if we won a court case saying it was legal to run a referendum, it would have to pass The Supreme Court, action by the UK Parliament, and an anti-Nationalist boycott. Easy, peasy! 11. We will continue to fool our supporters that ‘democracy’ is what we believe it to be, rather than the actual laws of Scotland and the UK. This will cause more division, but it’s a useful distraction from our 13 YEARS of failure in health education, jobs and the economy. 12.

A recent opinion poll ranked Scexit as only the 7th (18%) most important topic that would decide voting intention at the next General Election. Way out in front was the economy on 64%. This must be gut-wrenching news for independence supporters: 17 years in power and zero progress made in convincing Scots to vote for Independence. Could it be that when the idea of a constitutional solution to all of Scotland’s problems hits a cost-of-living crisis that has trashed the living standards of millions, the harsh reality of the present trumps the utopian vision of an independent future?\u0026nbsp; Especially when the party that would be responsible for delivering that future is currently mired in scandals and is increasingly perceived to be run by incompetents, who can’t even ensure ferries are built on time let alone be considered to be capable enough to deliver an independent country. In this General Election year, it’s clear to see the SNP’s polling ratings are tanking. The UK Supreme Court also made it quite clear that Holyrood cannot hold a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval meaning that all roads to achieving their dream of an independent Scotland are blocked for the foreseeable future. For the first time in 10 years the tectonic plates of Scottish politics are now shifting back from the Constitution to the traditional Left/Right axis. When the appeal of voting by constitutional allegiance is fading and electoral disaster is beckoning, the SNP need to do something — anything — to get politics back onto their preferred constitutional axis. \u0026nbsp;Prepare the Golden Grievance! A perceived slight so powerfully laden with anti-English sentiment and seared so deeply into the Scottish psyche, that it could automatically revive flagging support for independence and the SNP.\u0026nbsp; Now what perceived injustice carried out by the British State against Scotland could possibly meet that criterion? Redcoats to the ready! If you want to anger a bull, show it a red rag. If you want to anger a Scottish Nationalist show them the true symbol of British oppression –\u0026nbsp; a café named after Redcoats.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/BillDunblane/status/1756741096418185668?s=20 Never mind that said cafe has nestled in the grounds of Edinburgh Castle undisturbed since 1992, doling out tea cakes and scones, when Doug Chapman, an SNP MP,\u0026nbsp; came across news of its refurbishment, it was time to unleash a social media pile on to bully Historic Scotland into considering renaming this insult to Scotland. The horror! https://twitter.com/DougChapmanSNP/status/1756739202325094743 If the mere sight of the name ‘Redcoat’ makes a nationalist want to firebomb the café, one would think that there is a very real possibility that an SNP media campaign which focused on the notorious Battle of Culloden and its bloody aftermath would result in an army of Scottish nationalists storming Westminster, claymore in hand, demanding the head of Rishi Sunak on a spike.\u0026nbsp; More than that, a media campaign could shift the dial in favour of Scexit by stirring the emotions of even the most hardened pro-UK voter to the cause of independence, by demonstrating how brutal Cumberland’s army was to the highlanders. \u0026nbsp;Culloden and the horrific events which took place after it, is the ‘go to’ grievance used when nationalists want to point out how horrible Britain has been to Scotland. https://twitter.com/AUOBNOW/status/1515262791199899649?s=20 Without any historical context as to what the battle was about, Nationalists frame Culloden as a straight Scotland versus England battle where Bonnie Prince Charlie, the Catholic Prince Charles Edward Stuart, was in command of the 5000 strong Scottish Army. while the Protestant son of the King George II, Prince William Augustus AKA the Duke of Cumberland was in command of the 9000 strong English army. The atrocities committed by Cumberland’s army in the aftermath of the battle consisted of raping, pillaging, torturing, and killing highlanders in order to determine the whereabouts of the fleeing Bonnie Prince. As a result, the Duke was given the nickname ‘Butcher Cumberland’. The sobriquet of ‘Butcher’ one would have thought is evidence enough to give this historical event – automatic Golden Grievance status as every Scot has heard of Culloden and the notorious Cumberland. But hang on, was this as straight a Scotland versus England fight and English-led post battle massacre as the Nationalists would like you to believe? Culloden mythbusting If the Scotland v England framing of the battle and post battle massacre can withstand factual scrutiny this Nationalist grievance will indeed have achieved Golden Grievance status and arguably could be used in a co-ordinated SNP media campaign to remind Scots of what their ‘imperial masters’ did to them in 1746 without the fear of it being ridiculed for promoting false facts.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Firstly, Cumberland’s army was not an ‘English’ army. In fact, there were more Scots fighting on the side of Cumberland for the British Crown, than there were fighting against them in the Jacobite Army. A fact that never appears in any nationalist tropes about the battle. A third of foot battalions of Cumberland’s army consisted of Lowland Scottish Clansmen plus over 600 Scottish Highland Clansmen who all wore the Redcoat. As did one battalion and a militia raised from Clan Campbell Scottish Highlanders, plus other Scottish Clans that fought on the British side which included Munro, Ross, Sutherland, Grant, Cathcart, Colville, Sempill, Kerr and Cunningham.\u0026nbsp; So the verdict on the ethnicity of Cumberland’s British army would suggest that along with English soldiers it also comprised a large Scottish Clan contingent as well.\u0026nbsp; But surely it would have been just those beastly English soldiers who committed the atrocities after the battle? After all, no true Scotsman could have possibly been involved in committing such heinous crimes against their own kith and kin – could they? This article on the aftermath of Culloden published in the SNP’s house paper, The National, suggests - oh yes they could and they did\u0026nbsp; What happened next is Scotland’s secret shame. For it was not just English troops under Cumberland that carried out atrocity after atrocity in the search for Charles and the remaining Jacobites, but also Scots, many of whom were Highlanders themselves. John Campbell, the 4th Earl of Loudon, along with George Munro of Culcairn, co-founder of the Black Watch regiment in 1725, led the companies of independent Highlanders – Campbells and MacDonalds – who were loyal to George II on punitive raids into Lochaber and Shiramore while English dragoons roamed far and wide, killing indiscriminately. Finally, let’s state the bleeding obvious here, which strangely enough never appears in any Nationalist framing of these events either. Charles Edward Stuart and his Jacobite Army went to battle to usurp the Hanoverian King George II and place Charles’ father, James III on the throne in his place. It would therefore appear that a more accurate framing of this battle would be — wannabe British Army v real British Army. The evidence would therefore suggest that this was a civil war fought for the throne of Britain – not a fight between Scotland and England. So, in terms of Golden Grievance status the verdict must be, not even close and definitely no cigar. Tanks for the (fake) memories But are there any other Golden Grievance contenders lurking there which have seen Scottish blood being spilled by British forces?\u0026nbsp; Scottish Nationalists claim that there are indeed two events which meet that criterion, both involving the revered Sir Winston Churchill. The most notorious of these is the \u0027Tanks in George Square\u0027 myth. It was claimed up until fairly recently that this photo provided prime facie evidence that Churchill sent in 10,000 English troops armed to the teeth with artillery, machine guns and tanks to crush a 60,000 strong riot of striking engineers who had gathered outside the City Chambers in George Square demanding a 40-hour week. Although this myth wasn’t created by Nationalists (its chief perpetrator was Labour Lord Manny Shinwell) it most certainly was hijacked in an attempt to create a Golden Grievance to deliver Scottish Independence in 2014.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/RaggedTP/status/1646822468517081088?s=20 At initial glance, all the essential ingredients to create anti English sentiment are there – the English troops riding roughshod over unarmed Scottish strikers – the bonus of Scottish blood being spilled allegedly by said English troops. This myth also hits the jackpot for Golden Grievance hunters as it traduces the reputation of the most famous Britain of all – Sir Winston Churchill.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; However, the reality surrounding the events which took place that day, do not match the mythologised version. Firstly, the photo of the tank was debunked 99 years later as having been taken in Glasgow a year earlier in 1918 as part of a publicity drive to increase the purchase of Glasgow war bonds. The army, composed mainly of Scottish soldiers, not English, did not cause deaths and injuries because they arrived after the police had lost control of events. And Churchill did not send the army or the tanks in to stop the riot, it was the Sheriff who called for military assistance (which didn’t include tanks) after the crowd failed to disperse after being read the riot act.\u0026nbsp; Don’t let the facts get in the way of a good grievance. Abandoned hope The second charge against Churchill is arguably far more serious: That in 1940, he deliberately sacrificed the 51st Highland Division by ordering them to stay behind and fight off the advancing Germans, to enable 330,000 soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force and French troops to be evacuated from Dunkirk.\u0026nbsp; This myth first appeared in 1991 in a letter by ex SNP leader Gordon Wilson in the Glasgow Herald. But it is, once again, easily debunked: https://twitter.com/iccjock06/status/1089567216457187328?s=20 Firstly, Churchill could not have ‘sacrificed’ the 51st Highland Division, because he did not have the power to do so as the 51st was no longer under the direct command of the British Army. Command over the Division had been transferred in April 1940 to the French 10th Army under the control of Major General Victor Fortune who however did contact Whitehall but not Churchill himself with regards to the evacuation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; LIke the other myths, that idea that Scots were uniquely targeted by the evil British is once again proven false: As is the myth that the 51st Highland Division consisted entirely of Scotsmen which is not true.\u0026nbsp; Nominally a Scottish Highland division, the formation which had left Scotland in 1939 was nine months later as diverse as any regular British army division, with gunners from Staffordshire and Flintshire; Pioneers from Ayrshire and Norfolk; machine-gunners from Northumberland and London; and infantry from Kent, West Yorkshire, East Surrey, East Sussex, Shropshire, Cumberland and Nottinghamshire. The 51st (Highland) Division of June 1940 was Highland in name only and the defenders of St Valery were more than just the 51st Division.\u0026nbsp; Lastly but not least, the use of the word ‘sacrifice’ would lead the reader to suggest that the 51st were deliberately abandoned to fight on against the Germans. In fact over 15,000 troops were successfully evacuated, some even at St Valery itself. Which left 8-10,000 troops to surrender and spend the rest of the war in captivity.\u0026nbsp; What are we to make of this macabre search by Scottish Nationalists for a British inflicted injustice?The obvious conclusion from all three examples must be that Scotland does not have a Golden Grievance worthy of the name, which is why nationalists go to so much trouble to promote mythologised Scottish history to try to create one. As the end of 17 years of divisive nationalism draws ever closer, let’s all be extra vigilant and call out maleficent attempts to distort Scottish history for political gain, wherever and whenever we see it.

We affirm that every nation has the right to choose its own future. We choose a future where Scotland decides its own government…This is our plea, our right, and our opportunity: To place who live here at the heart of our national opportunity: democracy.” https://twitter.com/YesScot/status/1963589459661709337 This Right to Decide word salad also promises lower bills, stronger communities, and Scotland’s “rightful place in Europe.” A typical emotional plea, but it is also hollow. This campaign feels less like a blueprint for a viable future and more like a desperate bid to rally the base and cling to a dream that\u0027s already fading. As Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay put it in his first major speech, the “dream of Scottish independence is dead.” The Tories have even vowed to boycott Holyrood debates on the topic, focusing instead on devolved issues like the NHS and education. The movement\u0027s waning momentum is evident in sparsely attended rallies; for instance, a 10th anniversary event for the 2014 referendum drew humiliatingly small crowds, with organizers admitting the Yes cause has lost steam. Even larger gatherings, like the May 2025 march in Glasgow with around 5,000 participants, pale in comparison to the massive turnouts of the past. Polling shows that constitutional issues ranks a barely-there 17th on Scots\u0027 concerns and, even nationalist-friendly Sir John Curtice declares Swinney\u0027s referendum hopes \"dead in the water.\" The harsh truth: the case for independence is a deflated balloon: It’s a political, economic, and legally dead end. The Economics Don’t Work The 2024–25 GERS Report spells it out. Pooling and sharing resources across the UK gives Scots £2,669 more per head in public spending than the UK average. Scotland makes up 8% of the UK’s population but receives 9.1% of UK public spending. That translates into more money for schools, hospitals, and public services. Outside the Union, those fiscal transfers vanish. The reality would be less funding, deeper cuts, and decades of austerity. Independence would not be liberation — it would be ruin. The 2014 referendum should have settled the matter: No: 2,001,926 (55.3%) Yes: 1,617,989 (44.7%) Turnout: 84.6% — the highest in UK history. Since then, SNP support has consistently fallen short of representing even a third of the total electorate: 2015 Westminster – 1,454,436 (36% of electorate) 2016 Holyrood – 1,006,743 (25%) 2017 Westminster – 977,569 (24.9%) 2019 Westminster – 1,242,380 (30.6%) 2021 Holyrood – 1,192,789 (27.9%) At no point have they commanded majority support. Even the party itself knows the game is up. Humza Yousaf admitted on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “It is pretty obvious that independence is not the consistent settled will of the Scottish people.” He was right. Poll after poll confirms that most Scots want to remain in the UK. No Mandate, No Future Legally, too, the SNP’s argument collapses. Under UK Constitutional Law, independence is a reserved matter. No devolved election — no matter how many seats they win — can deliver a mandate for separation. Their victories entitle them to run a devolved administration, not to dismantle the United Kingdom. The reality that nationalists simply won’t face is that no other country allows a minority of separatists in one of its regions to think they have the unlimited right to break up the entire country. Yet the SNP still behave like medieval clan leaders, clinging to a romanticised vision of the past and pushing their obsession with separation while neglecting schools, hospitals, and basic services. Their “independence” project is based on fantasy economics, prejudice against England, and a misplaced sense of entitlement. The facts are undeniable: independence has no economic case, no majority support, and no constitutional validity. It is finished. John Swinney’s latest poster campaign is the desperate wail of a dead movement. It talks of rights, democracy, and a bright new chapter - but it cannot disguise reality. Swinney and his increasingly tired and desperate band of separatist have no path forward: independence is dead. Written by Stephen Bailey. Stephen is a commentator on UK constitutional issues.

It has been 22 years since the Good Friday Agreement was reached. After the 1997 General Election and the subsequent referendum on reconvening the Scottish Parliament for the first time in nearly 300 years, the April 1998 event was probably the third earliest political moment that I remember. At my tender age, I didn’t fully understand the details of the peace accord, but I knew it was a significant moment in the history of our country. A couple of months later, our primary school group began reading a book called ‘The Twelfth of July’ by Joan Lingard, a Scottish novelist who lives in Belfast. The novel is the first in the ‘Kevin and Sadie’ series of books. The first book was written against the backdrop of the start of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969, and follows the romance of Sadie Jackson, a Protestant, and Kevin McCoy, a Catholic. It’s a brilliantly written series, and as the curriculum didn’t feature all five books, I used my pocket money to purchase the remainder of the books to read at home. The later novels follow the couple to England as they embark on a secret marriage away from Belfast, such was the controversy during The Troubles around people in Ireland marrying if two people came from opposing religions. Growing up in Midlothian in the 1990s, and I’m sure for most who grew up away from the West of Scotland, it didn’t truly matter to the overwhelming majority of people what religion your parents were. My parents, still happily married today after 43 years, got hitched in September 1977 in St Matthew’s R.C. Church, Rosewell. If you care about the details, my dad was raised in a ‘Proddy’ household in Loanhead, and my mum was one of eight children to Irish Catholic parents who emigrated to Britain and settled in Rosewell. I now consider myself an atheist, but was taken to mass as a child. Though, just as you would be taken to the church that your mother frequented, it goes that the majority of us who are football fans go with the team our father supports. My team is Rangers, and very proud of them I am. I have been a season ticket holder in the past and try to visit Ibrox as frequently as I can. Supporting Rangers and attending a Catholic primary and secondary school of course meant those of a blue persuasion were vastly outnumbered throughout our school years, but any hostility was confined solely to matters on the football pitch. I left school in 2007, and wonder if the same could be said today, thanks to the explosion in anti-British sentiment we’ve seen in Scotland since the SNP came to power. You may be asking what this trip down memory lane has to do with Scottish politics. Well, I want to explain my understanding of religion in Scotland and peace in Northern Ireland as a young child before I started to get older and realised how complex and divisive these issues are. I can only conclude from my experiences as an adult that the decades-old bigotry and grudges masquerading as ‘political activism’ that brought Ulster to its knees, during those dark decades, have now fully been imported into Scotland. Christianity is becoming obsolete in Scotland quite rapidly, and politics is the new flashpoint in town. Instead of bombs and bullets, social media and the domination of local and national government are the Scottish Nationalist Party’s weapon of choice.\u0026nbsp; If you are active on social media and pro-UK, you will have no doubt been met by the sight of a cybernat with a Saltire emoji and an Irish tricolour emoji in their profile. They usually barge into friendly discussions, hunting down ‘Yoons’ and generally unleashing a barrage of abuse, accusing us of being ‘traitors to Scotland’ or ‘selling our souls for Westminster gold’, until they are muted or blocked. They view the dissolution of the United Kingdom as a ‘struggle’ between their righteous cause and big bad ‘Westminster’ who ‘stole Scotland’s oil’. These anonymous online foot-soldiers aren’t driven by a centuries-old dispute over territory, but by the words and deeds of party leaders living in the present. In today’s more secular Scotland, Sturgeon, and many other Nationalist figures, including her ghost rival for the soul of the party, Joanna Cherry, espouse Ireland as what Scotland should aspire to be like, despite its dependence on Brussels. In truth, Ireland is held up as a shining example of virtue by Nationalists because there are votes in it for them. There are many Scots of Irish descent who hold a romantic affinity with the Emerald Isle, and when blended with so-called ‘civic nationalism’, Nationalist leaders have tapped into the perfect formula for aspiring to be something that you actually can’t be, because someone or something (in their case, Westminster/England) is supposedly holding them back. There is significant political capital to be made by the Nationalists from playing, and let’s call it what it is, the sectarian card. Although there is an extreme element to the Nationalist’s core support who see Scotland’s constitutional future being a ‘struggle’, I wouldn’t write this article without acknowledging that there are also many, many great Scots of Irish descent who are pro-UK, because they recognise that the UK is a powerhouse of shared economic, political, social and cultural interests. Although not necessarily patriotic flag waving Brits, they are comfortable with the constitutional settlement and resist being drawn into extremism. It is, therefore, imperative for us to hold a mirror up to the ugly, divisive nature of Nationalist politics, while rejecting any civil unrest, such as the scenes we witnessed on a midweek evening in Glasgow’s George Square recently by a group of troublemakers going by the name of the National Defence League. On either side of the police line, extremists are looking for a 21st century version of The Troubles to emerge, disrupting and poisoning our everyday discourse which is already toxic enough, placing us into tribes, dividing society down Nationalist vs ‘Unionist’ lines. So, the next time you witness Nationalists trying to drive us down the path towards a sectarian war, call them out. Call out their bigotry, and let’s work to reduce them to the rump they once were, through facts, reason and good old common sense. We have the tools to win the argument all day, but need to use them wisely. Damien Scott is the founder of Scottish Opposition Forum. Help us fight back In less than a year there\u0027s going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nationalists will use it to continue to agitate for a disastrous referendum.

Humza Yousaf has proposed that an independent Scotland adopts a ‘written constitution’: Westminster has already been able to undermine the devolution settlement, override decisions made by an elected Scottish Parliament...In future, Westminster sovereignty could even allow the UK parliament to repeal devolution through nothing other than a simple majority vote. Meanwhile, Angus Robertson has labelled the UK\u0027s constitution ‘archaic’ and claimed that the lack of a written constitution is failing ‘to protect the key values’ held by Scots. He also claims that the UK’s constitutional arrangements are putting key Scottish values and fundamental rights at risk of erosion. This runs alongside the persistent theme that the UK Government is using Westminster’s sovereignty to undermine Holyrood without its consent.\u0026nbsp; Once again, the SNP show their contempt, disregard for, and gross ignorance of UK constitutional law. The UK constitution is an organic, living, evolving entity. It is based on precedent (what’s happened previously): the various statutes, conventions, judicial decisions and treaties which, taken together, govern how the UK is run. It is uncodified (not written down in one document), though it is based on some individual documents (such as Magna Carta (1215) and the Bill of Rights of 1689). This uncodified nature allows it a great flexibility to incorporate the best of the past (precedent) and to adapt to new developments. This is the main reason that the UK has largely avoided the violent upheavals (such as revolutions) and civil unrest that has regularly beset the Continent and other countries in the world. It enabled the UK to evolve into the fully developed, stable democracy it is today, before the introduction of legislative devolution pushed the UK into an ongoing constitutional crisis, that the SNP willingly provokes. Adopting a codified constitution would just further fracture the UK’s stability as a successful unitary nation, compounding the damage done by legislative devolution. UK constitutional law is clear on the issue of sovereignty, where it lies and where it is applied. The UK Government can draw up, and pass onto the statute book, legislation on any devolved matter if it is necessary for the good governance of the UK as a whole (such an act will be in force across the entire UK). There are limits: \u0027The Sewel Convention\u0027 applies when the UK Parliament wants to legislate on a matter within the devolved competence of the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales or Northern Ireland Assembly.’ Under the terms of the Convention, the UK Parliament (Westminster) will ‘not normally’ pass a bill on a devolved matter without the relevant devolved institution having passed a legislative consent motion.\u0026nbsp; The Convention highlights yet another dysfunctional aspect of the legislative devolution system set up by New Labour in the late 1990s, but it is not at the core of how Westminster’s legislative sovereignty works or the House of Commons’ alleged abuse thereof.\u0026nbsp; Whilst devolved legislatures can\u0027t actually veto legislation from the UK Parliament, they can hold up its implementation for a substantial time, causing disruption and discord between the constituent parts of the UK:\u0026nbsp; Legislative consent is a fundamental part of the United Kingdom\u0027s territorial constitutional arrangements. The self-denying ordinance of the UK Parliament that it will ‘not normally’ legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the relevant devolved legislature is a non-legal constitutional constraint. (UK Parliament research briefings) Modern aggressive nationalism (the SNP principally) tries to gain power by causing trouble with Westminster. It produces synthesised problems with proposed legislation in order simply to generate grievance and trouble. Nicola Sturgeon whilst First Minister, weaponised the Sewel Convention by conducting a campaign of conflict between Westminster and Holyrood that involved challenging as many pieces of UK legislation as possible. See, for example, the report by Michael Blackley, Sturgeon \u0027dialling up division\u0027 with refusal to approve UK laws. The Sewel Convention is just a courtesy. Under UK constitutional law, the UK Parliament can legislate on any devolved matter at any time and doesn\u0027t need the consent of the devolved legislatures to do so. That’s why it’s called a ‘convention’ – it’s a ‘gentlemen\u0027s agreement’ that Westminster will seek to consult and work in full cooperation with the devolved administrations before drawing up UK-wide legislation, but it is not compulsory. (The Convention is not a part of the legislation that set up Stormont, but is usually applied when Westminster is considering making legislation on matters that are devolved to Stormont).\u0026nbsp; The decision of Parliament to include these legislative provisions in relation to Scotland and Wales had no legal effect on the relationship between the UK Parliament and their respective devolved institutions. The UK Supreme Court confirmed in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union that Parliament\u0027s decision to put Lord Sewel\u0027s words into statute did not convert the Convention into a judicially enforceable rule. The Sewel Convention can, however, easily be manipulated by modern aggressive nationalism. This is the case with the SNP particularly, but not exclusively, as the stunt by the Welsh ‘parliament’, where anti-UK nationalists Plaid Cymru (PC), and the Labour Party recently voted against the UK Government’s, Retained EU Law Bill, which aims to scrap EU-era rules and regulations, claiming it \u0027undermines devolution\u0027. This is to the detriment of the effective administration of the UK.\u0026nbsp; It’s the anti-UK nationalists, principally, but not exclusively, the SNP, who have, through either knowingly ignoring, or ignorance of (or a mixture of both) UK constitutional law, abused legislative devolution, not the UK Government at Westminster.\u0026nbsp; UK constitutional law is completely clear on the issue of sovereignty: The House of Commons is the UK’s sovereign legislative parliament. Across the entire UK, the people (the electorate) hold ultimate political sovereignty. They authorise their representatives (MPs) to carry out a programme of policies that they approve of (laid out in the MPs\u0027 manifesto) by voting for them in a general election. Under constitutional law, the House of Commons (HoC) holds ultimate legislative sovereignty on behalf of and authorised by the electorate (that is, the ability to turn the policies voted for by the electorate into law) and in a unitary country like the UK, therefore, the HoC, and not the devolved legislatures (Holyrood, the Welsh ‘parliament’ and Stormont) is the supreme sovereign legislative body in the UK. Holyrood, the Welsh ‘parliament’ and Stormont (or the London Assembly for that matter) are NOT sovereign bodies and the UK is a single (or unitary) country, not a ‘union of sovereign nations’.\u0026nbsp; It is also important to note that, in a unitary country such as the UK, as legislative sovereignty ultimately lies with the central political power, such a nation is a single country with constituent parts that pool their resources for the common good and not a ‘union of sovereign nations’ because, as previously stated, ultimate legislative sovereignty lies solely with the central political authority (the HoC in the UK’s case) and remains there, even after powers have been devolved to constituent parts of that country.\u0026nbsp; In a unitary nation, like the UK, ultimate legislative sovereignty lies with the central power, in our case the HoC. That central authority can devolve any amount of power it chooses to any number of regions of itself, but ultimate legislative sovereignty remains entirely with the central power, which can revoke, in part or full, those powers simply by repealing the Acts of Parliament that set up the devolved powers in the first place. It is essential to note that the act of devolving powers to a part of itself in no way confers or transfers sovereignty to that devolved region (as opposed to federalism, in which sovereignty is transferred to the state level of the union).\u0026nbsp; The principle of the ultimate legislative sovereignty of the HoC is confirmed even by the Holyrood website, which states:\u0026nbsp; Under this system of devolution, Scotland is still part of the United Kingdom and the UK Parliament in Westminster is sovereign (has legislative ultimate power). This may surprise nationalists, who act as though Scotland is a separate country, but we live in a country called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This country is a unitary, or single, nation, not a confederation of sovereign nation states as anti-UK nationalists, and even some of those that want to maintain the Union, assert.\u0026nbsp; Before the 1706–07 Acts of Union, England and Scotland were completely separate sovereign nations, although they had shared the same king since 1603. After 1707, both Scotland and England ceased to be independent sovereign nations and formed a single composite country, Great Britain, in which ultimate legislative sovereignty and the resources of the two countries were pooled for the mutual benefit of both.\u0026nbsp; The Scottish Parliament was abolished after a vote by its members, and the HoC became the national parliament of Great Britain in which national legislative sovereignty resided solely. Scotland was now one of four parts of the UK Union (along with England, Wales and Ireland (Northern Ireland after partition in 1921), not an independent sovereign nation. This process was similar to how many European countries evolved, such as Germany, Italy and France. The HoC can decide to create or remove devolved areas at any time. It can delegate (devolve) power over any number of matters to any other part of the UK at any time. However, whilst power to decide policy on devolved matters to whatever degree within their devolved remit is transferred to the designated member of the Union, national sovereignty remains with the HoC and is not transferred. Holyrood, the Welsh ‘parliament’ and Stormont are not the sovereign national parliaments of their parts of the UK, they are sub-national devolved legislatures with responsibility over the matters that have been delegated to them, within their devolved remit. The Scotland Act, which was set up primarily by Scots for Scots, limits the powers of the Scottish Parliament. It is no surprise that the constitution is a reserved matter, and so Holyrood, the SNP, the Welsh, and NI devolved legislatures as well as the nationalists in Wales and NI, have no business getting involved in it, irrespective of it being their reason for existing.\u0026nbsp; Added to this, the leader of the biggest party in the devolved legislatures, is the First Minister of that devolved member of the Union (a civil servant in the executive arm of the UK political executive), NOT the Prime Minister of an independent sovereign nation. They have the responsibility to legislate on, and the authority to speak on, purely the matters devolved to them, not reserved matters, which are for the consideration of the HoC.\u0026nbsp; The leader of the biggest party at the HoC remains the national Prime Minister of the UK, with responsibility over, and the authority to speak on, national UK matters (in fact, the HoC can consider and pass laws on ANY matter, including all those in the devolved remit of the local executives at any time, but, as mentioned above, due to the Sewel Convention, will endeavour not to get involved in devolved matters.\u0026nbsp; The fallacious anti-UK nationalist narrative, which is increasingly becoming accepted even by some that want to maintain the Union, that their part of their UK is a sovereign nation that’s in a loose confederation style constitutional arrangement with the rest of the UK, just isn’t supported by either history or constitutional law. It must be very firmly challenged and the real facts laid out at every given opportunity if the constitutional integrity of the UK is to be maintained. Complacency and apathy will just aid the spread of this fallacy, with the consequential effect of boosting anti-UK nationalism in its efforts to break up the UK.

And for good measure, I asked it to weave in the titles of Taylor Swift songs. Why not? --- Wings Over Scotland recently revealed a plan for a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), which has been taken on wholeheartedly by Ash Regan, that can only be described as a fairytale, swirling with magical thinking and a total detachment from reality. The plan sings a story we know All Too Well: A fragile 50%+1 majority vote in a Scottish or general election, being used by the Scottish Government to announce a technical declaration of independence, demand negotiations with the UK government, and seek recognition and support from the international community under the UN Charter. Alas, a closer examination of this plan reveals it to be an Enchanted castle built on the sand of faulty promises and false assumptions. It has no Style. The 50%+1 majority vote is an arbitrary target, a filled-in Blank Space, that conveniently overlooks the broader electorate. If this majority were based on a 50% turnout, it would only represent 25% of Scottish voters—a rickety foundation for a new nation. Furthermore, the notion of declaring independence with almost half of the population against the idea, is not a Love Story. It\u0027s an open invitation to civil unrest, resulting in a lot of Bad Blood. The Scottish Government\u0027s capacity to declare independence is a pesky detail Wings seems to have missed. Sturgeon\u0027s failed Supreme Court challenge made it crystal clear that the devolved administration has no constitutional powers, rendering any declaration of independence as unlawful as one of Tim Rideout\u0027s banknotes. The UK Government, equipped with a manifesto commitment and the power to preserve the UK, would likely scoff at negotiations based on fake referendum results, leaving Wings Out of the Woods. The role of the United Nations in this misguided adventure is also woefully misunderstood. The UN is unlikely to act on an unlawful declaration of independence from a devolved administration. Scotland is not a colony, and its citizens are not deprived of human rights. Moreover, the UN primarily serves as a platform for chatter, lacking enforcement powers like a tiger without teeth, making it unable to compel any state to break itself up. Wings might think that The Best Day lies in UN intervention, but reality suggests otherwise. Appealing to the international community is Wings\u0027 Wildest Dream. Few countries would willingly dive into another nation\u0027s internal dispute, particularly when it is based on an unlawful UDI declaration and a fake referendum. The thrilling prospect of seeking support from countries like Iran, China, and Russia raises eyebrows and is far from ideal, a situation where Everything Has Changed. Wings\u0027 belief that his proposal presents an \"uncontestable democratic basis\" is, ironically, inherently undemocratic and authoritarian, a Delicate dance with danger. It is not democratic to use any election as a de facto referendum without the consent of those opposed. A fake referendum and unlawful UDI declaration cannot be used to shatter the UK\u0027s territorial, social, economic, and military security, especially after a real referendum has already taken place. Wings\u0027 attempt to challenge this authority is like trying to Catch A Falling Star. Wings Over Scotland\u0027s UDI plan is a fantastical fairytale, devoid of any basis in reality. The path to independence, if one exists, must be paved with pragmatism, legality, and democratic consensus, not magical thinking and a blatant disregard for the rule of law. It is time to wave goodbye to this misguided adventure, Shake It Off, and seek out more viable options. In the wise words of Taylor Swift, perhaps it\u0027s time for Wings to look in the mirror and realise, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" and instead embrace a New (Romantics) approach to finding a solution. With Wings\u0027 UDI plan resembling a tangled web of delusion, it is essential to remember that in the pursuit of independence, You Need to Calm Down and tread a path that respects both the rule of law and the democratic will of the people. As the enchantment fades, let\u0027s hope a more practical, grounded, and consensus-based approach to Scotland\u0027s future emerges; one that doesn\u0027t involve any more magical thinking, and instead focuses on finding a solution that unites rather than divides. After all, wouldn\u0027t it be nice if, instead of a fairytale, we could tell the story of a united, prosperous Scotland that Begins Again? Mark Devlin is the publisher of The Majority.

What is the aim of the party? The party’s flagship policy, of course, is to abolish the Scottish Parliament, which we consider to be a divisive waste of money. We believe that the £100 million running costs each year would be better spent on health and education, and that the powers and funding that the Scottish Government has centralised in Edinburgh, should be returned back to local authorities. The grounds of the Parliament building should be turned into homes for veterans. Who is behind the party? The party was co-founded by myself and John Ferguson, who was a UKIP Candidate in 2016. My own background was with a small party called A Better Britain Unionist Party, which was involved in North Lanarkshire local politics. We did well in our local ward of Fortissat, in the Harthill and Shotts area, beating the SNP, but fell a little bit short, behind Labour. Our press officer is Mitch William, who most recently was in The Brexit Party. We have people from a range of different party backgrounds. From the Brexit Party, through the mainstream Unionist parties, to people with no party affiliation. We will be standing multiple candidates in each region. We certainly have the public and media interest. What triggered you? There’s no party that represents an anti-devolution position, and that is the traditional Unionist position. I think it’s become more evident to an increasing number of people that Devolution is incompatible with the Union. So long as we have devolution, we\u0027re going to have institutional separation from the rest of the Union, with pooling and sharing resources being taken away from the rest of the UK.

My background is as a freelance graphic designer, so that’s been extremely useful. But mainly, we are getting the engagement because we’re the only party that’s articulating our position. There’s a lot of talk of a coalition, but what if a coalition fails? Do you think a new, Scotland-specific anti-Nationalist party could take on the SNP? I think a dedicated third party will increase division, because it will inevitably distance itself from Westminster. You can see that tendency in the UK level parties when they have\u0026nbsp; a separate Scottish arm. For example, Douglas Ross and the Scottish Conservatives are now pitching themselves against the UK party, by opposing elements of Brexit and siding with the SNP on issues of immigration and House of Lords reform. This is all an inherent part of devolution. So long as there are Scotland parties, whether Nationalists or Unionists, it will diminish what we do as the United Kingdom. Isn’t it just a protest vote? We will pick up votes from a lot of different angles and different demographics. Our basic abolition position will attract a lot of unionist votes as well as protest votes. People are fed up with the political parties, especially this time when the liberal-left consensus seem to have taken over Holyrood. Then there’s the Conservatives who believe in small government, and who are really outraged at the waste in Holyrood. And Labour voters who are concerned about public services, waste and lavish Holyrood salaries. In terms of policy, we do have a number of positive policy proposals that we can implement, even with a small number of MSPs. The anti-devolution position is against the nasty, authoritarian policies that are a product of devolution. When you have a devolved assembly that doesn’t have real responsibilities of the national parliament, it will tend to make legislation to make itself appear busy. We will support a Unionist coalition, against the SNP, to get the SNP out, working with Conservatives and Labour.\u0026nbsp; A common criticism of new parties, like Alliance For Unity, is that they will split the anti-Nationalist vote. Aren’t you splitting it further? We wish all Unionist parties well, including Alliance For Unity. We actually set up our party in 2018, and have been going for a good while. I don’t think Alliance is so well developed yet. They appear to be having issues with registering at the Electoral Commision. They may have to rebrand, and it’s not long at all until the election. I think Abolish is the ideal ticket for working within the Holyrood system. People will give first vote to the candidate best suited to beating the SNP and their second vote to Abolish.\u0026nbsp; Compared to, say, Alliance For Unity, Abolish has a clear, single policy. Alliance doesn’t have any policies; they’re going to sit as independents, so people don’t really know what they’re getting. With Abolish they know, it’s a clear policy...so I think it’s a stronger ticket and message. The electoral pact that Alliance has been talking about has already been rejected by the major parties, so I’m not sure what they bring to the table. Do you intend to push for a referendum on abolition? We’re standing directly for a parliamentary mandate to abolish the Parliament. Our initial target is to win these seats away from the Greens, to take the last seats on the list. If we can win those, we can articulate the anti-devolution position, build that position and work towards a parliamentary mandate. No referendum? No referendum. The process of referenda is very divisive and inadequate way of dealing with complex issues. They reduce complex issues to a binary choice. The last thing Scotland wants is another referendum. Our ideal scenario is to get a parliamentary mandate to abolish. How will you work as members of an anti-Nationalist coalition? We are against any further devolution. At the moment, Labour and the LibDems both explicitly support more devolution, and even Federalism. The Conservatives, under Douglas Ross, are advocating for additional powers to be devolved. Even if a coalition didn’t outright support abolition, we can bring a lot to the table, providing an anti-devolution perspective, and make it a condition of our participation in any coalition that there must be no more devolution of powers to Holyrood, and that power should be devolved from Holyrood to local areas, such as police and fire and rescue services that have been centralised by the Scottish Government. It’s astonishing that the position of abolishing the Scottish Parliament can have the level of public support it has and not be represented in party politics. A Panelbase poll in 2019 showed that 57% of Conservatives support our flagship policy of abolishing the Scottish Parliament, yet we have the Scottish Tories, and other parties pushing for ever more devolution. We stop all that. John Mortimer is the co-Founder of the Abolish The Scottish Parliament Party.

M. Jolly is not his normal sunny self: “We’re doomed, I tell ye … doomed.” The minister’s eyelids have been fluttering like moths since the Church of Scotland was stripped of its status as the official religion in Scexit Scotland. “And to think I supported Indy,” he groans.\u0026nbsp; “The referendum asked ‘Do you believe\u0027 …,” the wistful clergyman recalls. “So, of course, I answered YES,” he admits, “… at least on Sundays.”\u0026nbsp; He’s not the only one who is searching for answers. “There’s huge instability in the belief sector nowadays,” explains Mungo Ninian, Professor of Faith Marketing at Strathclyde University. “The big spiritual brands are totally undercut by local upstarts.”\u0026nbsp; “Look at the rise of The Church of the Better-day Scots.” A glance at the map shows that the ‘Scotman’ sect is spreading like wildfire as the search for a post-Scexit saviour figure intensifies.\u0026nbsp; Crowds gather for a vigil at Melrose Abbey, praying for the return of Robert the Bruce to guide the nation to the true path. Meanwhile, the so-called Braveheart wing waits for a sign of Wallace. “There have already been several sightings at a car park in Pollokshaws.”\u0026nbsp; As the movement expands across the country, Professor Ninian is also following a number of niche-faiths. “There’s even a fascinating sub-sect that worships Bruce Willis.”\u0026nbsp; It’s all part of a rise in Scottianity, the burgeoning identity-based faith. Under Scots law, a religion does not need a god as such – a belief system is enough. Start-up faiths therefore, tend to combine spirituality, nationality and economics, often with a touch of canny puritanism.\u0026nbsp; Handmade Scottianity chastity kilts are already an unexpected post-Scexit fashion icon. “We all know that skirts rise in boom times, but now we’re seeing kilts constrict after the economic downturn,” Professor Ninian explains. “With the job market so tight, it makes sense that our sporrans tighten too.” And it’s not just the lost souls of society who’ve turned to Scottianity. The middle class has begun to embrace new beliefs and rituals. Last month, The Tablet was invited to witness a new Scottianity marriage ceremony up in the heathery wilds of Perthshire.\u0026nbsp; As the bride and groom emerge from the bothy, the Faith Facilitator beams for photographs with the happy trio. “Cheeeese!” A familiar face beams out among the throng. “Och, for Salmond’s sake … fancy seeing you,” cries the new Bishop Jolly, benevolently.\u0026nbsp; Much has changed since The Tablet last interviewed the former kirk minister. “Y’see, when I converted, I was put on a fast track to promotion. The sales techniques we learn are an absolute revelation. I now have a thriving flock and the kilts are selling like hot bannocks.” In fact, it’s all go for the new bishop. “Tomorrow, we’re preparing the crib for St Nicola’s Day. We’ll all partake of the communion dram and oatcake and there’ll be Black Bun and Clootie Dumpling. You’re most welcome to come and join us.” Rev. Jolly certainly has no time for regrets. “Must dash. The wedding reception’s at our cock-a-leekie soup kitchen.”\u0026nbsp; With so many new souls to save, Professor Ninian believes that it’s the ‘have-a-go’ identity entrepreneurs who are truly seizing the post-Indy opportunities. As a prophet in search of a profit, Rev. Jolly gives the thumbs up as he vrooms away in his saltire-topped, bishop’s BMW.\u0026nbsp; “Merry Scotmas!” he cries. “We’ve boomed, I tell ye … boomed.”","date":"2020-12-13","summary":"The Scexit Files: The Tablet, 1 Dec. 2026 The Reverend I.

The sun is shining and, by chance, they are grazing one of the paddocks that has Criffel, the South of Scotland’s most beautiful mountain, in the background.\u0026nbsp; Gayatri (George’s wife) is behind the camera and despite being outside her comfort zone, gamely scrambles under the electric fence and gingerly picks her way in patent leather ankle boots between the cowpats to set up.\u0026nbsp; It takes several takes as each time I launch into my soliloquy the cows come up and start nuzzling me, so that we get the giggles. Gayatri clearly thinks I must be St Francis of Assisi. I have to explain that dairy cows are very tame as they are handled every day, whereas if they were beef cows they might have attacked us.\u0026nbsp; I take the opportunity to make another video explaining how vulnerable the dairy industry is to a hard Scexit. There is nowhere near enough processing capacity to deal with all the milk produced in Scotland. Thousands of litres of milk go south as far as the English Midlands each day. A hard border at Gretna would be a disaster. Farmers are also terrified of the SNP’s currency plans (or lack of them) as we all have large loans in Sterling, which we would be hard pushed to service in any new, devalued currency. \u0026nbsp;*** The trolling by other unionists continues apace on Twitter. Apparently we are responsible for ‘splitting the vote’. One minute they accuse us of being a threat to their parties, the next minute they say we are not going to get any votes anyway. Hmm! It’s as if Tesco, Morrisons and Asda are telling consumers not to shop at Aldi as it might depress their market share.\u0026nbsp; There are actually thirteen pro-UK parties standing on the list in this election. If All for Unity had not launched a charm offensive last year to try to get all Unionists under one banner, there would be seventeen, because the Scottish Unionist Party, Workers Party, Reclaim and the Scottish Christian Party would all be contesting this election, but we are never given any credit for that.\u0026nbsp; We tried very hard to get the leaders of three other small parties to subordinate their egos for the greater good, but sadly they declined. They know who they are. *** I now understand why previously friendly Tories on Twitter and party drones like Henry Hill and Stephen Daisley are attacking us so aggressively. A Tory, disgusted by the party’s arrogant sense of entitlement to list seats inherent in its attacks on A4U, has sent me a leaked document entitled ‘Rolling Brief: Scottish Parliament Election 2021’ produced by the Scottish Conservative Research Department (I wish we had one of those).\u0026nbsp; It tells party members to accuse us of ‘splitting the unionist vote’ and encourages ad hominem attacks on George for his previous speeches in support of a united Ireland.\u0026nbsp; I think most voters are sophisticated enough to understand that Ireland and Scotland are not the same at all, with very different histories and a completely separate set of circumstances.\u0026nbsp; Nevertheless, it makes us a target for the more extreme type of unionist, which is a frustration for those of us who risked our lives to keep the peace in Northern Ireland, ironically while the young journalists attacking us were still at primary school.\u0026nbsp; The leaker’s assumption is that the Tories’ internal polling is showing All For Unity doing far better than they expected. They would rather have ignored us. There is a rather naïve assumption among their more unquestioning followers that A4U will simply evaporate if they keep attacking us. They forget that George Galloway is too big a beast not to have an impact and if they were to be successful in keeping A4U below the level at which we would win seats, it wouldn’t help the unionist cause.\u0026nbsp; It would be better to get behind us so that our votes, which are not divided by any d’Hondt handicap, are leveraged to the maximum. They also forget that for every one person in Scotland who supports the Tories there are four who don’t, so making A4U their enemy risks making lots of other voters our friends.\u0026nbsp; The Tory strategy is to get everyone to give ‘both votes Tory’, which flies in the face of every bit of tactical voting advice. It seems to be rather like circling the wagons and hoping the Apaches have run out of arrows. Sometimes, I despair. *** As the campaign progresses I am more and more impressed by our candidates. It has been a risky business selecting fifty six people with whom to stand shoulder to shoulder, particularly, as unlike any other party, we have gone out of our way to try and represent just about every viewpoint as long as it isn’t nationalist.\u0026nbsp; It has been astonishing to see how socialists and capitalists, Protestants and Catholics, townies and countrymen have all pulled together. We have resisted the temptation to be too prescriptive in telling our candidates what to say and this has led to the flowering of some great talents on Youtube videos– Catherine McCall’s impassioned defences of free speech, Niall Fraser’s oratorical brilliance on the subject of SNP perversions, Charlotte Morley like a tigress in defence of her cubs, and many more. I feel sure that whatever the result of the election Scotland will not have seen the last of these people. *** A leading member of the paperazzi turns up at George’s to try and get some photographs to sell and we do a photo shoot on his lawn holding up A4U placards. George then mounts his soap box for some oratory for video and delivers a virtuoso performance, off the cuff, no notes, one take. Respect.\u0026nbsp; He then remembers that he has to be at the surgery for his second Covid vaccination. It’s a reminder that he is old enough to be Sturgeon’s, Ross’s or Sarwar’s father.

I have known this man most of my life. We have similar political perspectives. We are employed in very similar fields; in fact, this man is almost identical to me, as many have noted, except he is English and I, Scottish. As we discussed the state of the nation, he turned to me, and with a sigh, said: \"I\u0027ve really had enough of all this bitterness, it may just be for the best for Scotland to go\". This man is not in any way a nationalist, far from it. Still, he has become a thriving subject in the SNP\u0027s ventures into foreign policy. The SNP are attempting to turn public opinion in England against them, as representatives of Scotland, so that the English will get fed up and want us gone, to gain a bit of peace and respite from the constant antagonism and division. That’s why the SNP have turned parliamentary debates into fanatical speeches on Scottish secession, are working to undermine the credibility and image of the UK both domestically and abroad, and have endeavoured to ensure that whatever course the English electorate may choose, they must choose it under constant threat of aggravating another grievance. Recently on Twitter, I saw a clip from a BBC comedy sketch in which an Englishman complained about his dealings with a Scot saying that \"no matter how much I give him, and no matter how generous the terms, he will claim to be hard done by and go on about it forever\" and \"William Wallace died in 1305, when will you let it go? At this rate you will still be going on about him in the next millennium\". https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1352006173055217664 In retort, the Scot said what could stand as a script for Ian Blackford\u0027s next parliamentary speech, noting how Scots are in \"permanent occupation of the moral high ground\". The sketch was well received by the audience and got many laughs. As all great comedy does, it reflects and satirises real life. Many viewers will have seen, and felt, exactly the same as the characters did in the show. However, to me, it was not funny. It was painful. Painful because in this humour I saw the cutting edge of the SNP\u0027s policy towards the English, to turn them against the Scottish by being a perpetual bore and grievance, to permanently, yet undeservedly, claim the moral high ground and to project themselves as inferior, rejected, and somehow lesser in all things: A perspective which some SNP affiliated personalities have made repeatedly clear in the most embarrassing attempts at exceptionalism I have seen after decades studying nationalism. The SNP want to break a bond that goes back well beyond the Act of Union. A bond formed by centuries of friendship, love and family. A bond formed by a common interest, and common reward. A bond tempered in countless conflicts which cost us all countless lives. We have laughed together, and we have mourned together. To the SNP, this is both treason and a target. To the SNP, everything is a target. Every strand that connects us is a target. They are willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to cut each strand until all that remains is animosity and resentment. Their recent actions show yet again how they aggravate every situation to their advantage. Why haven\u0027t English and Welsh fishermen suffered as much as Scottish fishermen? Because the SNP have purposely failed to prepare and wished to use this transition to their advantage. Even as the sun rose on the first day of the year, they schemed to make political mileage out of their own attempts at complicating things needlessly, to foment a grievance and try to win a few votes. In the meantime, our fishing communities pay dearly. It fills me with contempt and disgust to see the SNP, and other nationalists, turn the trials of the past year into simply more grievance against our closest and economically most important neighbours. All they know is divide and conquer. They don’t care one iota for the lives and livelihoods they risk. For the SNP to succeed, they must break our bonds and they must break the people\u0027s political will to cherish and protect them. In Scotland, they attempt to break them by blaming everything on our neighbours, as all nationalists do. In England and Wales, they attempt to break them by forever threatening them with secession and protest so that they will simply give up and walk away fed up with our perpetual grievance. The SNP have weaponised our identities and have turned us on each other so that they can rule whatever remains, no matter how reduced and wounded that society may be.

However, I had been awestruck by his debating skills in the US Senate, his passion in 2014 on the pro-UK side, and his commitment now to strategies that could beat the SNP and beat back the ugly and tiresome Nationalism that has brought Scotland to its knees. All of that is what got me talking with him about a new party to help break the stalemate. As I have come to know him more, and as I have become more aware of how the media distorts reality, I have taken a little time to understand his past. Combined with my personal experience of his passion for this fight, I think, perhaps, it’s time we re-evaluated Mr Galloway. He works for Russian Television. So what? George is very open about it. People like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir John Curtice appear on his Mother of All Talkshows on RT. George also works for American and Middle Eastern channels. I have no idea if the Russians are trying to bring about the break-up of Britain via this election. They certainly would not use a fervent defender of the UK like George to do so. It seems much more likely that the BBC, the British state broadcaster, is trying to subvert democracy and influence the result, by shutting George out of the televised debates.That GG has supported Irish republicanism. If anyone has a right to hold that against him it is me. I was blown up by the IRA and lost friends in Northern Ireland. That all ended when the Queen shook hands with Martin McGuinness. This struggle in Scotland against separatism is different and is about hearts and minds. What is not to like about a cross party, cross-society, Scottish pro-UK party founded by a half-Irish catholic?That he once campaigned for independence himself. He never did. He did campaign for the Scottish Parliament (like nearly every Labour MP at the time), which is why\u0026nbsp; they regularly trot out news photographs of George with a young Nicola Sturgeon and falsely claim he was campaigning for Independence.That GG pursued unauthorised diplomacy with Saddam Hussein. As a former soldier, who served in the First Gulf War, I respect his initiative in trying to avert a war. Blessed are the peacemakers. The hardest thing I ever did in the Army was to break the news to a widow that her only son had been killed. George succeeded in persuading Saddam Hussein to re-admit Hans Blix and the UN arms inspectors. George is criticised for what he said to Saddam Hussein but diplomacy has its own language and he was hardly likely to insult a brutal dictator in his own palace.That he sided with Arabs against British soldiers. He didn’t. George was arguing the theory of a ‘Just War’, an important philosophical theory that goes back to St Thomas Aquinas. It is very unfortunate that he used the blunt language he did to reinforce his point. Many of my generation of Army officers now accept that Galloway was right and Blair was wrong, and that George’s central point that Baathism was a lesser evil than Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism was absolutely correct.That he took part in a Big Brother TV show. George took part in a charity event that raised over £200,000. Which other Scottish politicians would have the celebrity to be invited into the Big Brother House or the sense of humour and ability not to take themselves too seriously?That he has abandoned his principles because he now consorts with Tories and Etonians. Absurdly, this seems to be what most upsets the BBC, judging by Martin Geissler’s now infamous interview. Here George is guilty as charged. It underlines the severity of the situation facing Scotland that George and I are standing together. But no one should be surprised. Tam Dalyell, another Etonian, was an important mentor of George’s. If only the other Scots in the Labour Party had listened to Tam, we might not be in the mess we are now.That All For Unity is George’s vanity project. No 66 year old with a young family, with a global broadcasting career and a large parliamentary pension would willingly take a pay cut to enter the snake-pit of Scottish politics. That certain parts of the media choose to pursue this crude narrative, is an insult to the 55 other candidates, which include a former tribunal judge, a procurator fiscal, a court lawyer, two GPs, former Labour and Tory candidates, former Army officers, the former RSM of the Black Watch, a businesswoman with an OBE for services to industry, former university lecturers etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePXtpmd8tQ0 Sure, George is an easy target for MSPs who have never said anything controversial, or even memorable, themselves. And for lazy journalists who are happy to do the bidding of the big parties in the hope of a safe seat one day for themselves. But if the pro-UK side fails on May 6 and Nicola Sturgeon gets back in – and bitter, abject failure that will be, however Douglas Ross and Anas Sarwar try to spin it – there is one man every sensible Unionist would want on their side in any fresh Scexit referendum campaign, and that is George Galloway.

To achieve this, a political party will use several different tactics, such as catchy slogans, announcements, cover-ups and more. All these tactics fundamentally rely on someone to convey them from the party to the public: journalists and influencers that dominate the media and the online world.\u0026nbsp; The SNP have been able to control the narrative well, hiding their overtly divisive nationalism and objectively terrible record in government, which has allowed them to convince, or at least dissuade, criticism from most casual readers. The SNP has relied on many things to achieve this, but above all, they have relied on a sympathetic Scottish media establishment that they have, in turn, given either preferential access or outright bullied. However, this is changing, and now even the most sympathetic journalist must be starting to question their loyalty to the SNP and its messaging strategy.\u0026nbsp; Even those who support secession have called out the SNP for being a bloated, arrogant and corrupt party with all the hallmarks of an upcoming and very well-deserved fall. Publications that once rallied around the SNP now openly comment against them. One needed only look at the Twitter feeds and reflection articles during the Salmond scandal to see no love lost between former friends.\u0026nbsp; The SNP are entering this election cycle without a sympathetic media by their side, They are no longer able to shape, or direct, the narrative. This is a catastrophic loss. I have often cautioned people about raving about conspiracies in the media because journalism is fundamentally a commercial profit-driven business and\u0026nbsp; \"if it bleeds, it leads\". A media outlet, and by that I mean an actual journalistic outlet unlike Pravda, RT, NK News or The National — will run a story no matter how damaging, if they think it will result in greater sales and influence. And therein lies the start of the feedback loop of narratives. As of today, in the last five polls, there has been a dramatic drop in trust in Nicola Sturgeon, declining support for the SNP and increasing support for the UK. These results come atop the lasting political fallout of the inquiry, damaging revelations and all the debris of 14 years of awful leadership.\u0026nbsp; As the SNP starts to unravel, people want to know more, and the media, once neutered, is only too willing to oblige. But that leads to more questions that need more answers, generating a feedback loop with each step fuelling a further discussion and a spiralling whirlpool of narrative outside of the SNP\u0027s control. They can’t stop it because they no longer have sympathetic journalists who would not write such things.\u0026nbsp; This downward spiral is already in effect, with even international sources commenting on the drop in support for ‘independence’. The SNP are, of course, scrambling to stop this, but the flood is now in full flow. Over the past few days we had: revelations that an SNP staffer had been silenced by the party after attempting to report sexual harassment by two SNP MPs; the fact that half of the UK funding for end-of-life care had not yet been spent; and the SNP pinning blame on Rangers football club. They can’t generate enough good stories about themselves to outweigh the negative ones. The feedback loop is becoming a downward spiral that is now dominating the media narrative.\u0026nbsp; Of course, for those of us who know the SNP\u0027s reality and what they have done to our country, it is frustrating to only now start to see a change in the way the media talks about the secessionists. Still, it is a welcome change nonetheless. I expect it to continue as the election cycle heats up and as more about the twisted nature of the SNP is revealed.\u0026nbsp; The Salmond scandal still has a long way to run; pressure on publishing the OECD report will build, the allegations of sexual harassment will be further explored, and the empty promises of the SNP will be put to debate. In the meantime, do your bit. Using the same old adage of \"if it bleeds, it leads\" and knowing that journalists pander to their readers, be sure to read, like and share stories against the SNP as this will help to change the widespread discussion and will encourage journalists to write more on the topic as they know they have a ready audience.","date":"2021-03-11","summary":"Controlling the narrative is vital to any information, or disinformation, campaign in politics and in policy.

The 197 foot ‘gothic rocket’ survived the attempt to drill through its supporting pillars, but Sir Walter Scott’s head did not. Police cordoned off the scene as engineers inspected the damage. The attack is the most daring act so far in the unofficial MLM campaign to cleanse Scotland’s capital of ‘colonial’ symbols ahead of the first anniversary of independence in December.\u0026nbsp; Activists have branded the renowned author of Rob Roy and Ivanhoe a “two-faced traitor.” In 1822, Scott controversially invited George IV to Edinburgh dressed in kilt, sporran and full Highland regalia. A statement on the group’s MacFacebook page slammed the visit. “Two centuries of cultural appropriation and Old Reekie still stinks of it!”\u0026nbsp; Teller machines at the Bank of Scotland’s corporate HQ witnessed further protests by the MLM youth wing. Customers received their currency with “Scotland’s Quisling” obscuring the writer’s portrait. “We’re very proud of our work on this art project,” an MLM spokeskid commented. Attempts to quiz the youthful protesters on their knowledge of Sir Walter and/or the Norwegian traitor were answered in brief bursts of Anglo-Saxon. Police Scotland declined to comment on the day’s events until a full investigation is completed, but prosecutions are said to be unlikely after the government’s recent Hate Symbol Act (2024). An official at the Scexit Ministry insisted offensive visual representations were a national affront, but any changes should only be carried out after official approval.\u0026nbsp; Speculation is now rife that Sir Walter’s statue will be replaced by a more appropriate figure. Sources at Bute House denied the new Heid o’ Government was in the running for the honour. “She’s flattered of course, but it will probably have to be Connery,” a source suggested. Sir Sean was the largest donor to last year’s successful independence campaign and further contributions are needed for next month’s Bagpipe-a-thon after Dyson, the previous sponsor, pulled out suddenly. Political reactions were mixed. Alex Salmond condemned the move in a video released from his home in Moscow. “If that woman puts up a statue to 007, it bloody well proves she’s a British agent!!!” But financial markets moved largely in line with expectations as the Scots pound continued its downward trajectory – along with Sir Walter’s head.

Experts agree, not since De Gaulle ended a state visit to Canada with ‘Vive le Quebec libre\u0027 has anyone let loose with such a rip-roaring, undiplomatic stinker.\u0026nbsp; Signing autographs, the man of the moment grinned to the cameras. “I’m so proud of this MSIA hat – y’see, it sounds like Messiah...a second coming for Scotland.”\u0026nbsp; “Yeah, those Hebridee-be-jeeby islands are my second home … my mother’s motherland...the Outer ones and also the Inner ones...it’s a quality set, if you’re collecting them...” “Y’gotta be careful with real estate, though,” he warned. “Many people don’t realise Greenland isn’t even green – an iceberg, probably – but listen, my old mom gave me the Heebie-jeebies … and I’m proud of it …” A spokesperson for Scotland’s First Minister was tight-lipped about the presidential choice of headwear, but party sources were shell-shocked: “It’s the endorsement from hell.”\u0026nbsp; Reports indicate that the Trump Organisation quietly copyrighted the MSIA slogan after the first independence referendum in 2014. The president’s former advisor, Steve Bannon, has admitted working on a grand coalition of political disrupters across the world including Trump, Putin, Berlusconi, Erdogan … Farage and now the SNP: “We nationalists are building an Alliance for Disunity,” he grinned. Experts at the Centre for Strategic Studies suspect Trump may also be looking for a bolthole, if the legal noose begins to tighten round his business empire, once he loses presidential immunity. “I don’t think he’d fancy living in Moscow, but Turnberry might just suit him.”\u0026nbsp; At the Scottish Government’s ‘Homecoming’ campaign HQ, the scene echoed Munch’s ‘Scream’ as scurrying staff ran the press gauntlet. The department has been targeting 40 million people with Scots ancestry, encouraging tourism and investment in the mother country. As a major investor, Trump would be entitled to a fast-tracked Scottish citizenship application...maybe even political asylum. “Homecoming has turned into Hellcoming,” admitted an ashen-faced official. But some strategists believe the SNP might be willing to live with Trump’s support. “The truth is, he gives us access to some of the richest Scottish diaspora in the US. We may need them after Scexit.”\u0026nbsp; The party has embraced right wing moguls in the past. Both Rupert Murdoch and Stagecoach tycoon, Sir Brian Souter, have admitted to past dalliances. Trump is only the latest in a line of flirtations with the filthy rich. Asked how he got on with the First Minister, the president was in Casanova mode. “We’re getting closer and closer … like lips and teeth,” he drooled. “It’s love, actually. We both wanna leave NATO and we both hate that stinky Salmon guy.” “The First Lady had to fumigate her dress after being in the same room with him … know what I mean.” Meanwhile, Trump’s ‘Messiah hats’ are selling as fast as they can churn them out at a factory in Kilmarnock. “We thought we’d have to close down after the latest lockdown,” said owner, Dunlop Carnegie, “but the President’s order has given us a lifeline. He’s stronger for Scotland.”\u0026nbsp; The question now is, what’s Trump up to? Could he even be planning a run for the Scottish parliament? Experts agree, anything could happen.

The spike in second thoughts has continued to spread across Scotland, but finally the long-awaited Anti-Unionist vaccine (ANTI-U 27) has been given emergency approval by regulators. Officials welcomed the announcement. “As we have said repeatedly, the Scottish government has always followed the ideology,” a spokesperson insisted. “But now I am pleased to say we have five million doses of hope.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Supporters were euphoric. “From Tier 4 to Tears of Joy,” hailed The National in a front page editorial. The jag comes just in time for embattled ministers trying to contain the virus. The over-fifties have always been vulnerable, but persistent hotspots in Aberdeenshire, as well as the Northern Isles and Borders, are now spreading to parts of the Central Belt.\u0026nbsp; Efforts to quarantine people from dangerous economic data have only been partially successful, resulting in a persistent rise in second thoughts in areas previously considered invulnerable. Growing evidence suggests that the recently unemployed and those with mortgages are particularly susceptible. Despite intensive therapies, including upbeat announcements, patriotic songs and even reruns of Braveheart, the success rate has been patchy. “The problem is that much unionism is asymptomatic,” a government source explained. “It’s often unaccompanied by any flag-waving and other tell-tale signs, so people don’t know they have it – until it’s too late.”\u0026nbsp; Prof. Howard Firth of Caledonia University believes the vaccine will be a game-changer. “Basically, it works by blocking the nervous system’s natural doubt receptors using an infusion of utopian euphoria. This acts to stimulate the brain’s tendency towards tunnel vision.” Further tests indicate that it produces strong scapegoating antibodies that help protect the patient from most forms of evidence and counter-argument. The vaccine will be delivered in two doses, with a patriotism booster three weeks later.\u0026nbsp; Questions still remain. Experts suggest that 80% coverage will be needed to achieve full herd immunity, but it is not clear if this is achievable, especially outside so-called ‘Middle Scotland.’ Sceptics worry it may be too late to avoid lasting damage.\u0026nbsp; Aberdeen University’s Dr Hugh Pennyfeather warns the country should brace for the worst. “I suspect that total isolation – blockades, even – may be necessary in the end, though it’s not clear if ministers have the funds to support a full lockdown, especially without a stable currency.” Ministers, however, remain confident. Asked if the vaccine would work, the Health Secretary was unequivocal. “Trust the ideology – be stronger for Scotland.”","date":"2021-01-09","summary":"The Scexit Files: The Herald, February 2028 Not since independence have ministers been so upbeat.

It’s not a joke, it’s exactly what happened to me two weeks ago. Until this time, I had never interacted with George Galloway and had never felt any wish to do so. From nowhere, a series of tweets appeared from the former MP, urging pro-UK political parties to form an alliance to defeat the SNP. Intrigued, I contacted Mr Galloway, not expecting a response.\u0026nbsp; The next day, I received a reply asking me to call him. I did so and was immediately taken by how closely aligned he and I were on the major issue facing Scotland – the fight against Nationalism. He even used phrases which I have used on social media. Thirty minutes later, I had agreed to stand as a candidate for Alliance For Unity. The UK has a rich history of political alliances. They have typically occurred when political parties have chosen to work together to achieve a shared goal. In Scotland, the need for an alliance has never been more pressing. Even after 13 years in Opposition, Scotland’s pro-UK parties are wholly unable to land meaningful blows on the woefully inadequate SNP administration. First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, talks to Scottish Conservative party leader Jackson Carlaw as if he is Boris Johnson\u0027s press secretary, rather than the leader of the Opposition.\u0026nbsp; Some Conservative MSPs are openly stating they will lose their seats in the Holyrood elections in May 2021. In the last 12 months, two of Scotland’s most talented politicians, Ruth Davidson and Adam Tomkins, have announced they will not stand again. The outlook for Scotland’s pro-UK voters has never looked as bleak. Fortunately, a viable alternative to the SNP has arrived. The Alliance For Unity is Scotland’s fastest growing political movement. The movement will field list candidates in the 2021 Scottish Parliamentary election and thanks to the proportional representation used in Scottish elections, the movement stands a real chance of winning seats. Statistics show the wishes of the Scottish electorate are not being represented. In the 2016 Holyrood election, over 1.8m eligible Scots voters did not even vote. In the 2019 UK General Election, 1.6m Scottish voters did not get the MP they voted for. Something new is desperately needed and this is what I believe the Alliance For Unity offers. The Alliance has already announced candidates in some constituencies. They range from ex-Army officers, legal professionals, farmers and IT consultants to experienced political campaigners. Alliance candidates represent a wide range of political opinions on non-devolved issues but on the crucial issue of Scotland’s UK membership, we are all aligned: Scotland must remain in the UK. There must be no more divisive referendums as we adapt to life post-pandemic. This is the reason I have decided to stand against the SNP. I have a background in business rather than politics. After graduating aged 22, I spent many years working in IT in the Aviation and Travel sectors before running my own IT consultancy business. A lengthy battle with illness finally ended earlier this year, so I have been seeking a new challenge, and this opportunity has arisen at exactly the right time for me. If elected to the Scottish Parliament, I will work tirelessly to ensure the Scottish Government focuses on Scotland’s real priorities: education and health care. I have personal experience of the appalling level of care afforded to Scotland’s elderly population and I will ensure this stops. In addition, I will encourage the Scottish Government to research new treatments for diseases considered incurable, as I have first-hand experience in this field. I hope to bring genuine passion and determination to bring about much-needed change. Lastly, I will be an outspoken critic of corrosive Nationalism which has damaged the fabric of Scottish life for too long. Join me.

While claiming she was \u0027for social justice\u0027, she said that she was all for anyone being Scottish, except for JK Rowling. When I asked why, she told me that Rowling should be excluded because of her political views. Whatever you think of Ms Rowling, or transgender activism, this woman, who presumably thinks she is a decent person, told me straight up that someone with a different political opinion from her has no place in Scotland. Add that to the many Nationalists who routinely call for their Tory or \"Red Tory\" opponents to \"go and live in England,\" claim their opponents are \"traitors\" and that they \"hate Scotland\" and we see Nationalist thinking on a massive scale.\u0026nbsp; But, the media barely shows how this abuse affects ordinary people. There might be the occasional article about politicians receiving abuse, but this morning I read of someone who has had enough, is selling their house and moving their family south, and I talked with an English-born man, who has lived here for over 30 years, who now whispers he doesn\u0027t feel comfortable in Scotland.\u0026nbsp; It doesn\u0027t take long to find abuse online. Cybernats, an aggressive army of online bullies, are primed to descend on anyone who dares criticise St. Nicola or the objectively poor performance of her government. Women routinely receive death and rape threats. Today, I read about how an openly gay man, who was hounded off of social media, and whose employer was sent hundreds of homophobic emails falsely accusing him of despicable acts. So much for equality. Not to mention the people who’ve lost friends, and the families torn apart.\u0026nbsp; How did we get to the situation where any of this is acceptable? Growing up in Scotland, there was the odd joke about the English, reasonable football rivalry, and some minor grievances about English football commentators. Nationalists were a tiny minority and their inferiority complex, crass supremacism, and \"It\u0027s oor oil\" greed was rightly mocked. Returning to this country, after 26 years overseas, and having worked with people from all across the world, I am appalled at the casual bigotry in Scotland. From people who really should know better. How did these Nationalist traits become mainstream?\u0026nbsp; The answer is simple: Nationalist politicians inflamed grievances to gain power. There was, and still is, no problem that isn\u0027t \"Westminster\u0027s\" fault, despite huge sections of the economy, like the NHS and the Police, already being under Nationalist control. It accelerated with Alex Salmond, who cleverly, and very successfully, distorted language to brand anyone who opposed his divide-and-conquer power grab in ugly terms as a \"Unionist\", a \"Red Tory\" or a \"British Nationalist\". And under Nicola Sturgeon, Nationalism continues unabated, in its slick, professional incarnation: Bigotry in a smart suit.\u0026nbsp; At no point did these leaders step in to stop the division. They have never called their followers to account. They have never apologised. They have never tried to heal. Because, if there was no division, they would have no power. In particular, by not accepting the result of the 2014 Referendum, they continue to sow dissent. Think of the difference if they had actually said, \"We did our best, but we lost, let\u0027s give it a rest for a while -- a generation perhaps -- and get back to issues that the majority of people care about.\"\u0026nbsp; Yet not a day goes by without a new pronouncement by Nicola Sturgeon and her ilk diverting blame for their own failures to \"Westminster\" (which, of course, really means “The English”). Sadly, opposition leaders have not been able to stop Nationalists taking control. Perhaps they have been distracted by their own issues, but now, more than ever, we need opposition leaders to see what is happening, and fight back effectively, by targeting Nationalism as a toxic ideology. I often like to compare the situation in Scotland with what life might be like one mile south of the border. If anyone in England said that someone \"should leave the country,\" due to their politics or ethnicity, they would rightly be seen as a disgusting racist. Yet in Scotland that talk is not only acceptable — it’s policy. It\u0027s time to call it out. I say to that well-meaning lady who wants to send JK Rowling back home: Do you even realise what you\u0027re saying? Why did you trade social justice for brutish Nationalism? What are you getting out of it? And how much power did you give to the people who stoked the fire? If you receive death or rape threats, please contact us. If you have suffered abuse from Nationalists online or otherwise, and if abuse has forced you to lose friends or family, please talk to us. Bullying is never ok.

The Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy (SSLN) found that only 49% of 13/14 year olds were performing \"very well\" or \"well\" in 2016, down from 55% in 2014 and 64% in 2012. It is against that backdrop that the SNP need a bolder drive and ambition to get Scottish school children all of the classroom time they can.\u0026nbsp; Nicola has had since March this year to plan for this provision, and that is precisely what is happening in the Scottish public school sector, but the SNP are letting down the majority of pupils who attend state sector schools. Dr Devi Sridhar, Professor \u0026amp; Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University Medical School, used her professional expertise to set out a target for getting kids back into classrooms as normally as possible and on a full-time basis, rather than the ‘blended’ learning approach which is the SNP’s plan A rather than plan B.\u0026nbsp; Dr Sridhar said: If COVID-19 numbers can be brought low enough in Scotland by 11 August (under 20 confirmed cases) \u0026amp; with appropriate \u0027test and protect\u0027 policies, my personal view is that schools should reopen as normally as possible (kids back full-time \u0026amp; able to play/interact together) But the next day, that position appeared to have been completely withdrawn and brought into line with Nicola’s line: @NicolaSturgeon \u0026amp; I are completely aligned \u0026amp; I support her cautious approach to easing lockdown \u0026amp; re-opening schools. She has kids (\u0026amp; teachers, parents) best interest in mind so better to go slowly, track virus closely \u0026amp; make decisions in a reasoned \u0026amp; data-driven way. It is worth noting that in April Dr Devi Sridhar also commented online “If you’re wondering why more public health people didn’t speak out publicly in early March… fear of losing grant income is key factor.\u0026nbsp; Those of us who have been speaking out know it’s going to be very hard to bring in grant money now.” Does she mean the SNP censor people, or at the very least, discourage people, who are not helpful to their position on the issue of the day?\u0026nbsp; Well that’s news to me(!) That tweet is now deleted.\u0026nbsp; Fortunately I was able to retrieve it from a Google search cache : Let me be clear here – for too many children in Scottish society, the school environment is the only piece of stability they have in their lives.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Whilst laptops and broadband connections can be provided, in too many cases the home environment is not conducive to learning and therefore the blended learning approach will simply entrench existing inequalities within our society - inequalities which are growing under the SNP, with kids from underprivileged backgrounds half as likely to get to university than their counterparts in England, despite their fabled free (edit: collectivised) university tuition fees. If Nationalists fail to get children back as normally as possible in August, they will consign more children to a failed education and damaged life chances, and given the acute lack of planning by local authorities around Scotland, it sadly looks like that is what is going to happen. In Dumfries \u0026amp; Galloway, council bosses have said kids would only go back “two or three days each week”; in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire Councils, it would be twice a week; in South Lanarkshire, they are projecting a fifth of normal capacity, and again pupils will only get two days classroom education per week. This should be the back-up plan, but given the stages local authorities are at here in June - some time away from new terms commencing in the middle of August - it looks as if these part-time plans are being firmed up with no hope for a proper return two months from now. My heart breaks for what this will do to children who come from broken homes where there is literally no space to learn, perhaps an abusive or alcoholic parent at home with them, where a decent education would be their only golden ticket to a better life. Young families - a demographic usually strong for the SNP - are already socially distancing themselves from Nicola, with groups like UsForThem Scotland, representing concerned parents gaining thousands of supporters in the last few weeks, as they worry about how to cope with increasingly arbitrary rules.. Nationalists always say they are ‘stronger for Scotland’ but when it comes to our children\u0027s futures their inadequate actions reveal these words as meaningless. Prioritising false pride and Separation over consensual politics is not a lesson our children should have to learn the hard way. Our families and children deserve more.

The project has been so delayed it has even\u0026nbsp;outlived three previous health secretaries\u0026nbsp;who were looking after it, making Jeane Freeman the fourth. \u0026nbsp;I hear you all breath sighs of relief at that... The tender document stated the ventilation system had to be able to change the air in critical care areas four times per hour. Health standards dictate it should be 10 air changes per hour. \u0026nbsp;This mistake alone, with the revisionism of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the importance of this ‘technicality’ to life, will cost £16m to rectify and delay the opening further.\u0026nbsp; Well\u0026nbsp;over 300,000 children attending A\u0026amp;E have been denied access to the hospital\u0026nbsp;their parents were promised, over the duration of this delay so far. \u0026nbsp; The SNP say the hospital is due to open in November, but you’ll forgive me for saying,\u0026nbsp;“aye, and so did Guy Fawkes…” #4\u0026nbsp;She increased taxes – and raised LESS revenue for public services Although this is about Nicola’s failures, we really need to remind you, reader, that Derek Mackay was the Finance Secretary who increased tax rates - and actually\u0026nbsp;received £941m less in revenues than forecasted. \u0026nbsp; Nicola’s failing here was\u0026nbsp;appointing a Finance Secretary who didn’t know what the Laffer Curve effect is. \u0026nbsp;If she chose better, perhaps Scotland would have more tax revenues to invest in the public services that have decimated over the past 13 years and Scotland wouldn’t be the most highly taxed part of the United Kingdom to live in. This wasn’t the first time either. When the Scottish replacement for stamp duty was introduced – the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax – that and the newly devolved Landfill Tax\u0026nbsp;raised £38m less than forecast, again because Scottish rates were set at a more punitive level than elsewhere in the UK. #3\u0026nbsp;She handed welfare BACK to the UK Parliament When the Scottish Parliament eventually assumes its additional powers over welfare and benefits (assuming it’s not deferred by the Nationalists, again), the creation of the system to deal with those new benefits will have taken\u0026nbsp;a full nine years to deliver.\u0026nbsp;Nine years to setup a system to deal with what amounts to\u0026nbsp;15% of total welfare spend\u0026nbsp;in Scotland. That’s only\u0026nbsp;seven and a half years longer than the SNP claimed it\u0026nbsp;would take to setup all the mechanisms and accoutrement that come with ripping Scotland out of the UK, such as embassies, agreement on sharing broadcasting, infrastructure, border controls, etc. Listening to the SNP’s rhetoric, they make no bones about\u0026nbsp;making grievance\u0026nbsp;with the UK Parliament that welfare and benefits in the UK insufficient and unfairly penalise Scotland. Well, handing back the levers of power which allow you to change something you perceive to be wrong – twice – gets this one into the top five Hall of\u0026nbsp;Nicola’s Shame. #2 She failed to heal Scotland The campaign by the Nationalists to split up our country began in 2011. \u0026nbsp;It hasn’t stopped, despite the result being delivered in 2014 which shows\u0026nbsp;the majority of Scotland is anti-Nationalist. Since then, despite the Conservatives winning an outright majority in 2015 with only the one seat in Scotland back then, the Brexit result in 2016, Boris becoming PM in 2019 when he’s not as popular as his predecessors in Scotland, then Brexit actually happening in 2020,\u0026nbsp;the polls have remained stubbornly against the Nationalists. This settled will of the people of Scotland against Nationalism has resulted in growing tensions and frustration on that side of the debate. \u0026nbsp;Hardly a weekend went by before COVID-19 that a Scottish town or city wasn’t afflicted by Nationalists wandering around\u0026nbsp;hurling abuse\u0026nbsp;at people with Union flags, calling for people they deem to be ‘scum’ to get out of their own country, or even one I saw personally in Perth, calling for ‘England: Get Out of Scotland’ Studies have shown increases of racism and sectarianism in Scotland, and the dialogue used by Nicola herself has contributed to this, rather than attempting to heal the deep wounds which exist now in Scottish society. #1 \u0027Judge me on Education\u0027 The mother of all failures. \u0026nbsp;Screw up on education, and you break the economy, you break social cohesion, and you break law and order. This was\u0026nbsp;the test Nicola proudly set herself\u0026nbsp;on becoming First Minister. So let’s check her report card… No other policy area has seen such deep rooted and systemic change at the hands of the SNP than the education system in Scotland, and they’ve made a pig\u0027s ear of it. \u0026nbsp;After\u0026nbsp;abolishing tuition fees, changing the curriculum, changing the exams, changing the measurements, by just about every metric you could muster,\u0026nbsp;what was once the envy of the world is now a concealed, shameful little secret of failure\u0026nbsp;and missed opportunity. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) shows Scottish educational standards are as askew as the tower this acronym was inspired by.\u0026nbsp;Down in maths, down in science,\u0026nbsp;fewer young people from deprived backgrounds getting to university than England\u0026nbsp;(where they increased tuition fees let alone abolished them), employers desperately trying to plug the skills gap left by the SNP’s reformed education system. The nation which proudly shaped the modern world through innovation and enterprise would attract scorn from the likes of Adam Smith, Alexander Fleming and James Watt. Nicola said herself “judge me by my record on education” but she is forever removing Scotland from the measurements to do so, removing themselves from two international comparison surveys, and scrapping a number of domestic measurements here at home.

I’m looking forward to Jeane Freeman (@JeaneF1MSP) writing more of these from jail. #NicolasBookClub I hate to blow ma own trumpet, but...well, actually I love blowing it! These one’s are all about me! @NicolaSturgeon#NicolasBookClub This one\u0027s by ma pal Alex (@AlexSalmond). Who doesn’t love to snuggle up with a wee Limoncello on a freezin’ winters night? The best writers always work from personal experience, don’t you think? #NicolasBookClub 1984, what a book! I\u0027m really learning how to apply these tips from @HumzaYousaf. Forget Big Brother, he\u0027s a right Wee Brother! #NicolasBookClub After reading Clerkin’s guide on \u0027How to Report an International War Crime\u0027, I was hooked. Watch out: Genius at work! #NicolasBookClub Here’s a wee question: What’s Scotland’s national animal? No, it’s not the Unicorn. It’s the Deficit! A £13 billion monster that @AndrewWilson and I never want to talk about! Scary! #NicolasBookClub In a very shallow pool, Pat Kane (@thoughtland) is one of the indy movement’s deepest thinkers. I’m looking forward to reading every book in the series! #NicolasBookClub It’s amazing what you get when you mix politics, science, and SNP grant funding. Thanks @devisridhar! #NicolasBookClub I actually gave this a D minus, but @JohnSwinney regraded it to an A. Bastard! If John keeps failing upwards, he’ll end up with my job. LOL. #NicolasBookClub Parents, tell your kids to watch out for this one. #NicolasBookClub Ma wee pal from Glasgow, @janeygodley is one of the loveliest ladies on Twitter. What a laugh! #NicolasBookClub Editor\u0027s Note: Janey Godley tried to get this removed from Twitter and said \u0027she would send this to her lawyers\u0027. She didn\u0027t succeed (parody is exempt from copyright). Her efforts earned her The Majority\u0027s \u0027Thinnest Skinned Woman in Scotland Award\u0027. Tragedy or comedy? Or both? Robin McAlpine’s play really boggled ma wee brain. (@RLMcAlpine) #NicolasBookClub A wee shout out to ma hubby, @PeterMurrell. Go team Murrrell! #NicolasBookClub I just love what @MhairiBlack\u0027s done for kids’ education, don’t you? What an adventure! You’ll be rubbing your gums at this one... What would I do without @patrickharvie and the Greens? I’d have no government that’s what! So I’d better say Pat’s book is good. Remember to recycle it (quickly)! #NicolasBookClub Alan (@Alancumming) is my favourite celebrity Nationalist. I just love how gorgeous his Nationalism is. Division and greivance have never looked so good! #NicolasBookClub I loved @gerryhassan\u0027s first book. This is another one that really makes you wonder. #NicolasBookClub Finally, I don’t know about you, but this lockdown’s turned me into a wee fatty. Thankfully, the Scottish Resistance have come up with this AMAZING diet plan. I’ve already lost a few pounds and I\u0027m feeling more Scottishy already! Thanks boys! Well, that’s all folks.

Everything is sunny. There’s never any possibility of long detours, dangerous events, and dreich weather. Comparing Scotland to Nordic countries is simply a cheap trick that deflects from the reality of where we are now. What if we didn’t get to Norway or Denmark at all. Given the reasons below I think it’s more likely we will end up, at the end of a long or short road, in Belarus or Ukraine: A divided satellite with no voice in the world, on the periphery of Europe, with an intolerant angry government, based on grudge and victimhood.\u0026nbsp; Independence There is no such thing as ‘independence in Europe’. Professor Mark Blyth makes it clear that, regarding Europe, you cannot be independent without your own currency. It is that simple. Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark all have their own currencies. Some chose to join the German-dominated EU (with opt outs), others didn\u0027t.\u0026nbsp; The United Kingdom chose to leave Europe despite Nationalist wishful thinking that Scotland voted against Brexit. Over one million Scottish Leavers, many of them SNP members, would say otherwise. The EU Commision requires its member countries to follow the same rulebook for trade policy, and increasingly coordinates many of functions best carried out by sovereign states. No one in the EU votes for the Commission, or Council. You can argue for the EU on many grounds, but certainly not on political and economic independence.\u0026nbsp; Personal Freedom Alongside its main aim to break up the UK, the SNP has made repeated inroads into our private lives. Whether it be the Named Person Scheme, or the upcoming Hate Crime Bill, or the failed Offensive Behaviour at Football Act, or the ban on buying alcohol after 10pm, or recently, the arbitrary imposition of lockdowns with minimal evidence of value, Nationalists have always, throughout history, made every effort to nationalise people.\u0026nbsp; Nationalists might say they want their Nation’s independence, but they do not trust the people of their nation with personal independence. All they seek is power for themselves. Nationalists also do not respect our political decisions. Instead they waterboard us with constant threats to rerun a referendum they lost, and meaninglessly parrot that ‘Scotland voted Leave’. They do not respect that most ancient right for a Scot to be left in peace when they say no? “Are You Yes Yet?” is not an inspiration. It is the desperate pitch of the fanatic, who won\u0027t shut up and won’t change the subject. Political Freedom SNP Bravehearts never miss a chance to wave plastic swords and scream ‘Freeedooom!!’ \u0026nbsp;but the political reality is far, far different. And oppressive. No sooner had Westminster granted Holyrood emergency powers to deal with COVID-19, then the Nationalists abused that power to delay the flow of information to the public. Despite multiple attempts, I have still not been able to access NHS data over delays in treating those with blood cancers during the pandemic. Humza Yousaf will not waste five minutes in attacking an opponent on social media, but if you want data that would show Holyrood is failing cancer patients, you’ll have to wait over two months. This week’s inquiry on the dangers to women of sexual predation in Parliament itself is yet another example where Murrell Central appears to have reached out, and touched Linda Fabiani inappropriately, shutting down legitimate inquiry questions. Is this the freedom we want? Press Freedom Like many failed republics, The Scottish Government likes to threaten and harass journalists and broadcasters. David Torrance was attacked in party political broadcasts; Stephen Daisley chased out of STV by personal attacks; Sarah Smith forced to repeatedly apologise; and Neil Oliver was constantly attacked by The National newspaper, for the crime of having a Scottish accent and sense of British history. Add to that, Sturgeon’s stage-managed spin on a pandemic she has handled disastrously. A daily free party-political broadcast, worthy of a dictatorship, with no follow-up questions allowed.\u0026nbsp; Our levels of press restrictions and control are far from the open society of Denmark, Sweden or Norway who consistently rank high in press freedom indices.\u0026nbsp; If all these freedoms are being eroded now, one can only imagine how much more we would lose in a one-party Scottish Republic that had no internal or external opposition. Watch out! We are not heading for dreamy Scandinavia, but to restrictive Belarus, where your cries of ‘Freedom!’ will not be heard. Help The Majority fight back In just a few weeks, The Majority has grown to over 6000 social media followers and hundreds of thousands of article views. But, we still have a long way to go to beat Nationalist media, like The National newspaper, which pumps out ugly propaganda to over 100,000 followers. If you can, please pledge a monthly donation so that we can grow and be an even stronger voice against the ugly Nationalism that has engulfed Scotland.

Still, as always, reality is far from their fevered imaginations. For example, Separatist claims that \"independence is normal\" are easily dismissed by pointing out that many of the countries they claim to admire are, in fact, political unions, often far more recent than the UK. As time goes on, and their desperate cries for secession are revealed as a gargantuan political squirrel, I am reminded more and more of other Separatist movements that have done exactly what the SNP have done and got just about as far as the SNP will.\u0026nbsp; I am a firm believer in the academic principle of demonstrating my arguments with sound and applicable examples, unlike the SNP, who seem to be distraught by the fact that Scotland, no matter how hard they try, will never become Norway or New Zealand, and so here is one that I am confident you will find both informative and incredibly similar. So let’s talk about Canada, or more specifically Quebec, which is still part of Canada. Yes, the famously polite and non-confrontational nation of Canada had just the same issue that we see here today in Scotland and the UK, and its timeline and final outcome are a lesson to us all.\u0026nbsp; In the 1960s, a group of small political parties formed into the Parti Québécois (PQ), which, softly at first,\u0026nbsp;campaigned for the predominantly French-speaking region\u0027s secession from Canada.\u0026nbsp; In 1976, PQ won a majority in the local assembly and campaigned for a referendum, which was granted in 1980. However, they lost by a considerable margin.\u0026nbsp; In 1981, they returned with an even greater majority. Still, after losing their leader, they suffered electoral setbacks, and their plans were suspended while they promised to focus on \"good governance\" instead.\u0026nbsp; In 1994, the PQ returned to power with 45% of the vote and again started to call for a new referendum. Sound familiar?\u0026nbsp; In 1995, another referendum was held, but after a race in which they were consistently ahead in the opinion polls, the separatists lost with the remain vote taking 50.58% of the vote.\u0026nbsp; In 1999, Canada passed a \"clarity act\" outlining what it would take to hold another such vote in the future. The movement, while still active, has now collapsed and\u0026nbsp;polls around 36%.\u0026nbsp; Scottish Nationalists like to portray their cause as unique to history, claiming they are uniquely persecuted as a colonised nation (tell that to the millions who died under the Empire Scotland helped to create and administer). But in reality, they are simply another band of opportunistic malcontents out to trick people with cheap populism and electoral quackery.\u0026nbsp; As virtually every country on the earth is a union of once-independent polities, secessionist movements tend to crop up, make noise and then die away, as people get fed up with divisive politics, endless campaigning, and the inevitable stagnation which such parties bring to the political landscape.\u0026nbsp; Canada had to deal with them, the United States has had to deal with them, most EU nations have to deal with them, and we in the United Kingdom have to as well. That is, until they run out of steam and the rest of us are free to carry on with our own lives.\u0026nbsp; It is telling that, just as their party falls apart in a civil war of identity politics and conspiratorial intrigue, the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon are now suddenly changing tack and going for broke with an 11-point referendum plan that they know will go nowhere. It reeks of desperation, lack of control and an ignorance of history.\u0026nbsp; The SNP have only one shot left at a referendum, and the spectre of Quebec lies over their every action, and they know it. But, as those who don\u0027t learn from history are doomed to repeat it, they too will beat their drums and demand a referendum in much the same way their Canadian compatriots did a few decades ago. And, like them, they will face the same humiliating outcome. Angus Robinson is a lecturer at a UK university.

Anything that gets your goat, really.” The old breeder is especially fond of his ram. “He’s a pure Old English. In great demand, these days.” Prices have duly soared since Scexit. “It has been great for business,” he chuckles. Ever since border checks were introduced, you can’t get UK scapegoats for love nor money.\u0026nbsp; Mac is exhibiting his ram at the breeders’ equivalent of Paris Fashion Week, just outside Perth. “We call him Baa,” he explains, “… short for ‘Battering.’” In fact, he’s the only pure English on show this year.”\u0026nbsp; But nothing is left to chance. Baa’s very own Vidal Sassoon is doing the finishing touches. “Lovely goatee work. Very metropolitan elite.” Before Scexit, the blame market was usually covered by southern suppliers. Mac was lucky to sell a few local Scottish scapegoats a year – anonymously, to football managers mostly – but now he’s having to raise production to fill the gap. “Holyrood is pressuring us – we can’t keep up.” Older breeds are currently being revived. In the next pen, a couple of Doric scapegoats frisk about. “They’ve this really weird Aberdonian bleat,” says Mac, feeding them a handful of granite chips. “Hardy devils. Great when you have economic turmoil to explain away.” Over in the corner, attention turns to a flock of jet-black Shetland scapegoats chained up with tethers, all bleating their characteristic ‘daaa.’ “They’re cute wee things,” Mac says, patting one on the head, “but if you pull their teats, they produce high grade crude. Worth the effort, eh!”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “Trouble is … the little rascals keep trying to run away. My son calls them escape-goats. I’m not sure I’ll be able to keep them in their box, to be honest.” The loudspeaker booms across the arena. All eyes turn to Baa as he prances majestically down the goatwalk with a haughty swagger. “See, he’s lovin’ it,” Mac grins. “A proper star.” In minutes, Mac’s phone is hot with bids from anonymous buyers, some rumoured to be treasury ministers, according to reports. “I’m sayin’ nuthin’,” Mac winks. But the calculators are out. It looks like his accountant will be grinning for the rest of the season. PING!\u0026nbsp; A text has come in. Mac reads it, gazing at the words till his face sizzles pink with outrage. “Due to a critical shortfall, the Scottish Ministry of Home Affairs hereby orders, under Section 12 of the Civil Contingencies Scotland Act (2026), all Old English scapegoats requisitioned for compulsory purchase forthwith, with immediate effect.” “WHAAT!” wails Mac. “They can’t take my Baa. I’d rather have him roasted on a spit.” Baa flicks his ears on the winner’s podium. Something’s wrong – he senses it. Animal instinct kicks in. With one leap, he launches over pens and paddocks, rampaging through the rows of panicked poultry. The Doric scapegoats follow, making a dash for it as their Shetland cousins flee out the door, dripping oil in their path.\u0026nbsp; “EEE-I-E-I-Oh,” cries Old Mac, raising his hands to the heavens. “We’re ruined! RUINED!”\u0026nbsp; But after Scexit, there’s nobody left to blame.","date":"2021-01-24","summary":"The Scexit Files : Farming Today, 17 July, 2027 Old Mac is proud of his scapegoats. “My herd can be blamed for pretty much everything – from wars to w..."},{"title":"On yer bike","url":"/articles/on-yer-bike/","content":"With a grand fanfare, the SNP released their manifesto. Never have I seen such desperation and cynical attempt to pass off a promise that \"we will try to fix what we broke\" as something new and revolutionary, done in such a fundamentally self-contradictory manner. No doubt you will have heard the headline that the SNP will now give you a free bike. Well, one kid somewhere may end up getting their photo taken with a bike. A closer look at this fabulous generosity reveals a manifesto that combines the policies of Jeremy Corbyn with the outlandishness of Willie Wonka and the financial sense of Wesley Snipes.\u0026nbsp; Not only is the manifesto much less generous than it seems — particularly with regard to NHS spending — its entire funding relies on the most ridiculously illogical assumptions possible. The manifesto relies on a 20% increase in tax revenue and a 14% increase in the block grant from the rest of the UK, and will increase government spending from £45 billion to £90 billion pounds; This outlandish number should set alarm bells ringing like a Geiger counter in the heart of Chernobyl.\u0026nbsp; Where will the 20% increase in tax revenue come from? The SNP have again promised to freeze council tax rates (which they had also promised to abolish in 2007), and will now also freeze income tax rates. So those can’t provide a penny more for their projects. This means they will have to attract investment into Scotland, which they can tax.\u0026nbsp; It doesn’t take a financial genius to know that regions with political instability are not seen as attractive locations for investment. Why would anyone invest in a country that may, at a moment\u0027s notice, fundamentally destabilise its entire economy? Why would anyone want to invest in a country that doesn\u0027t even know which currency it would use? They wouldn\u0027t. While the SNP keep beating the separatist drum, there will be no significant inward investment to be taxed.\u0026nbsp; The SNP plan to use a 14% increase in the block grant from the rest of the UK to fund these giveaways. That\u0027s right; they expect UK taxpayers, those who reside in London, in Belfast, in Cardiff and myriad other places to pay for their bribes.\u0026nbsp; Furthermore, the SNP promises this investment over the next five years despite wanting to be a separate country as early as next year. This makes absolutely no sense because the moment secession is announced, the tap from London will be shut off, leaving those projects without any funding. No serious economist, or anyone for that matter, can take this budget seriously. It is the equivalent of trying to run a race while simultaneously sawing your legs off.\u0026nbsp; Of course, the fatal flaw in all of these giveaways is that they are planned by the SNP and will be operated by the SNP. Take the newly announced six-mile bridge between Gourock and Dunoon; the manifesto says it will cost £30 million pounds. It sounds exciting and interesting till you realise the 1.6 mile Queensferry crossing, which is often closed due to design failures and falling ice, took nearly six years to build and ended up costing £1.35 billion pounds.\u0026nbsp; Despite Nicola Sturgeon admitting that the economic plans in her party’s White Paper are \"out of date\" (in fact, the plans were never \"in date\"), she and others are adamant that secession is vital to Scotland\u0027s recovery from COVID, without being able to give us even a shred of economic evidence to support their position. Scottish politics is no longer about facts and figures, but is an exercise in mass cognitive dissonance.\u0026nbsp; Reading between the lines, however, their manifesto does not paint the picture of a confident party. It has too many giveaways, too many promises and too little substance to justify it; it stinks of desperation and \"one last job\". It feels rushed and panicked, feverishly cobbled together to stay one step ahead of a rapidly approaching enemy.\u0026nbsp; The SNP are blinded by their ideology, but even they must see that relying on money from the UK while trying to break away from the UK is not a stable platform on which to stand. Clearly, the economic and political picture is not a rosy one for the SNP.\u0026nbsp; With little public support for a referendum during recovery, it seems the SNP know they will not be able to force a vote within the next five years, and that those five years will not be kind to them. A vicious civil war and disaffected supporters and disappointed voters, have made the\u0026nbsp; SNP rightly fear that these coming years will be their last in power for a long time, so, with all the desperation of a cornered criminal, they promise the world and each other \"one last time, honest\".\u0026nbsp; It\u0027s pitiful to watch and will be painful to live through, but at this rate, we will be done with them long before any bikes are ever delivered.

Why not? We were told from the beginning that the purpose of the lockdown was to save the NHS being overwhelmed. Even at the height of the crisis, the NHS, staffed by our amazing carers, was never in any real danger. The Louisa Who? temporary hospital was, thankfully, never used. Today, there is no possibility of the NHS being overwhelmed, so why is Nicola Sturgeon saying we cannot go to shops or beer gardens for another two weeks? Breathing. Apparently, we can\u0027t have a beer in this beautiful summer weather because we don\u0027t have the right kind of breathing. This is utter nonsense. https://twitter.com/AgentP22/status/1273890058647621632 The only breathing we\u0027d like to see less of is the constant stream of hot air emanating from Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s mouth. Her daily grandstanding proves the maxim that the more we see of a politician, the less effective they are. More and more, it seems like Nicola is detemined not to let this crisis go to waste. We won\u0027t be bullied like Sarah Smith: We believe Nicola Sturgeon is enjoying it. She is using this crisis as an excercise in division and power: making pointless differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK to stir up division, and diverting blame to England wherever possible. All while taking billions of the UK\u0027s money. Money that would not have been available if Nationalists had won the Separation Referendum in 2014. We\u0027re tired of the continual grandstanding, the lies, the inept management, and the arbitrary rules. Today we heard that we can only visit one other family if they live alone or have children under 18. Or that people can visit Edinburgh Zoo, but only if they live within five miles. Do we have to wear matching socks too? And all while favoured political protests like BlackLivesMatter get a free ride. The myriad of rules is simply too aribitrary and confusing. That\u0027s the point: It\u0027s designed to paralyse us and keep us waiting for their next pronouncements. But, we\u0027ve had enough of this petty micromanagement. And this beer garden breathing nonsense is, for many, the final straw. In a poll we held today, by a massive margin (90.5% to 9.5%), The Majority\u0027s readers don\u0027t agree with this decision. So we say: Nicola, get off the TV, stop punishing hard-working business owners, give the public clear rules, and open our beer gardens now. Help us fight back In less than a year there\u0027s going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nicola Sturgeon and her cronies will use it to sow further division and continue to agitate for a disastrous referendum.

They are not based on any news, but serve simply to say, ‘If you write articles against Scottish Nationalism, you will be targeted’.\u0026nbsp; Contrary to their claims, I have not received a single email or telephone call from the National asking for comment. This is not only UNPROFESSIONAL, it means the journalist LIED multiple times in each article. I will be reporting this unprofessional conduct to IPSO. The objective of their article is not just to intimidate our writer, Angus Robinson, by trying to find out where he works and threaten his livelihood, but to intimidate any writer who is thinking of writing for us. By targeting Angus, and trying to dig up what they can on him to try and discredit him, they prove why Angus and other writers want to stay anonymous.\u0026nbsp; It’s no surprise that many commentators on Scottish Nationalism require anonymity. We all know that anyone who uses their real name to question Nationalism is subject to online and offline abuse and threats of violence, and, as the National proved today, their employers will be harassed under the guise of ‘journalism’.\u0026nbsp; The National and The Scottish National Party have created a society of intimidation and fear in Scotland. Speak out and you will be targeted. Angus made a good decision to protect himself. But in a decent society, he shouldn\u0027t have to.

Perhaps The National’s ‘editorial’ team knew that today we are launching a petition to ask Faure Walker and Mike Reed, CEO of Gannett, the US-based company that owns Newsquest, to cease publishing their anti-English hate rag, and decided to attack us first. It beggars belief that Gannett, an international media company that I have great respect for, and Newsquest, a UK publisher with readers, employees and vendors across the UK, would allow anti-English hate and intimidation of its opponents in its newspapers.\u0026nbsp; http://www.change.org/stop-the-nationals-anti-english-hate Help us stop the National\u0027s hate by signing here.

Despite the intentions behind devolution, the existence of devolved legislatures like Holyrood has amplified the separatist agenda rather than diminished it. To secure the UK, a pragmatic dual strategy—a short-term defense and a long-term solution—is required. The Failure of Devolution to Quell Separatism When devolution was introduced, proponents like Labour politician George Robertson claimed it would \"kill nationalism stone dead.\" Instead, the opposite has occurred. Over the past 26 years, Holyrood has provided the SNP with a powerful platform to dominate Scottish politics, displacing pro-UK parties like Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Far from reducing separatist sentiment, devolution has given the SNP a megaphone to advance their singular goal: breaking up the UK. The SNP’s obsession with independence is clear in their governance record. Rather than focusing on improving living and working conditions for Scots, they have prioritized pushing for separation referendums and centralizing power by stripping authority from local councils. Their disregard for constitutional constraints—such as the reserved nature of constitutional matters—further underscores their monomaniacal pursuit. This pattern is not unique to Scotland; similar dynamics, though less pronounced, exist with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland and Plaid Cymru in Wales. The reality is stark: devolved legislatures have not neutralized separatism but have instead enabled it. As long as Holyrood exists, the SNP—or any future separatist party—can regain power and resume their campaign for independence. Their strategy of \"neverendum\"—repeated referendums until they achieve their desired outcome—poses a perpetual threat to the UK. A fluke win or a war of attrition could eventually exhaust pro-UK resistance, leading to the breakup of the UK. The Short-Term Imperative: Tactical Voting Given the immediate risk of another referendum, short-term action is essential. The SNP’s current dominance in Holyrood must be challenged through a robust campaign of tactical voting. By uniting pro-UK voters to oust the SNP from power, the threat of an imminent referendum can be neutralized. This approach buys time but does not address the underlying structural vulnerability: the existence of Holyrood itself. Voting out the SNP is a temporary fix. History shows that separatist parties can return to power and resume their agenda. As the saying goes, they only need to be lucky once, while pro-UK forces must win every time. A more permanent solution is needed to safeguard the UK. The Long-Term Solution: Abolish Devolved Legislatures The only way to eliminate the perpetual threat of separatism is to dismantle the mechanism that enables it: devolved legislatures. Holyrood, Stormont, and the Welsh Senedd have become tools for separatist movements to amplify their agendas. Abolishing these bodies would remove the institutional platform that allows parties like the SNP to dominate regional politics and pursue their anti-UK goals. In their place, the UK should return to a system of common representation in a single, sovereign national parliament. The House of Commons, with its 650 seats allocated proportionally across Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, ensures that decisions reflect the collective will of the UK. Even if separatist parties like the SNP, Sinn Féin, or Plaid Cymru were to win every seat in their respective regions, they would remain a minority in Westminster, unable to force through their agenda against the majority of pro-UK MPs. This system is fair, democratic, and proportionate. It ensures that the moderate majority prevails while keeping fringe movements in check. Without devolved legislatures, separatists would lack the institutional power to advance their cause, reducing their influence to a manageable level within the broader UK parliamentary framework. A Dual Strategy for a Secure UK Defeating anti-UK separatism requires a pragmatic, two-pronged approach—a pincer movement to protect the UK in both the short and long term. First, tactical voting must be employed to remove the SNP from power in Holyrood, preventing an immediate referendum. Second, the devolved legislatures must be abolished to eliminate the structural risk they pose, ensuring that separatist movements cannot regain a foothold to threaten the UK in the future. The stakes are high. The UK’s survival depends on recognizing the failure of devolution to neutralize separatism and taking decisive action to address it. By combining immediate electoral strategies with a bold constitutional reform, the UK can permanently secure its unity against the relentless tide of separatism.

So the Sunday Times poll putting A4U on 4%, one percent behind the Liberal Democrats, is a bit like seeing one of the children winning their first egg and spoon race: It is heartening and frustrating at the same time.\u0026nbsp; Heartening that, after weeks of being lumped under ‘other’ in the question and therefore, being shown under ‘other’ in the poll result, we finally exist on Planet Psephology.

It looks as if they are also using the journalists Stephen Daisley and Henry Hill to stir up animosity towards A4U.

Dear old Tories, they are completely blind to the irony that in running total no-hoper candidates in what should be safe Labour or Liberal seats they are doing far more to ‘split the vote’ than we ever will. And George is not exactly a Tory icon coming to steal their votes. The crux of their argument seems to be that we are not proper Scottish Unionists because of George’s support for a united Ireland.

I have decided to go against my normal modus operandi and prepare a speech to read off the autocue.

Part 1 – How did we got here? Before a system can be fixed or abolished, we need a clear understanding of the problems and issues of the current system of Legislative Devolution: Constitutional conflict Centralisation Excessive spending Lack of accountability Constitutional Power Grabs It is a well-known fact that political organisations always aim to expand their power. In fact, devolution was set up, in principle, as a way to stop evermore power accruing in Westminster. What has actually happened, though, is that power has been hoarded in Edinburgh at the expense of Scotland’s local authorities, while the Scottish Government has tried to grab as much power as it can from Westminster, often aided by politicians who are either unaware or uncaring of the problems that would produce. Legislative devolution was supposed to be a junior tier of local government, but in reality, since coming to power in 2007, the SNP have pursued a programme of turning the devolved Holyrood executive into a kind of national government, including Alex Salmond’s unchallenged renaming of the Assembly into \u0027The Scottish Government\u0027 and installing ministers. The UK Government\u0027s indulgence of these pretensions has been detrimental to the stability and unity of the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, when First Minister, travelled around the world acting like she was the Prime Minister of a sovereign country: opening ‘offices’ (an obvious attempt at projecting the impression to the world that Holyrood is the national government of a sovereign country); trying to do trade deals on behalf of Scotland; trying to negotiate deals with Eurocrats over trade arrangements on Scotland’s behalf (all of which were outside her devolved remit); and going to America to drum up support for independence; among other misdemeanours.\u0026nbsp; In fact, the UK is a unitary (single) state — the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland — in which, whilst power over any matter can be devolved (or delegated) to other bodies within its borders, the state remains a singular political entity. Irrespective of devolution, the Parliament of the UK still retains full sovereignty, even over issues it has devolved to these provincial bodies, and can take them away at any time. The SNP has deliberately sought to pursue policies that clash with those of the rest of the UK, and then use any refusal as ‘proof’ of UK ‘oppression’. The SNP’s failed Second Independence Referendum Bill, its Gender Recognition Reform Bill and their Green Party coalition partners’ Deposit Return Scheme are three very good examples of this. These laws are framed as ‘Westminster denying democracy’, when in fact they are power grabs into reserved areas and into areas that affect other UK legislation. It took the UK’s Supreme Court to quash Sturgeon’s Referendum Bill, despite it being a reserved matter, while the UK Government has now invoked Section 35 of the Scotland Act to refuse to give Royal Assent to the Gender Recognition Reform Bill (GRR), which it says contravenes equalities law in the rest of the UK. Centralisation You only have to look at the example of the last twenty-plus years of the real-world effects of legislative devolution in the various parts of the UK into which it has been introduced, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to see that the centralisation of power in one assembly or parliament has led to a massive failure by that executive to improve the living and working conditions for that particular area of the UK. It is hardly a surprise that a nationalist movement aims to centralise powers. Since the SNP took over from Labour as the ruling party in the 2007 Holyrood election, it has steadily gathered powers previously in the control of local authorities into the remit of Holyrood (and consequently brought them under the SNP’s control as they controlled Holyrood).\u0026nbsp; This is both hypocritical and ironic. Since their inception 88 years ago, the SNP have complained about the evils of power being centralised at Westminster in London. Yet this is precisely what they have done in\u0026nbsp; Scotland. Their complaints that Westminster centralisation led to remote and poor government has been mirrored as they centralised power in Holyrood, away from Scotland’s regions and local communities. But it’s hardly a surprise. Nationalism is a centralising ideology that aims to put every institution under central state control. One act of centralisation that has led to major ramifications for the ordinary citizens of Scotland has been the major merging of the Police and Fire services. Police Scotland was formed on 1st April 2013, by the merger of several local constabularies that had previously policed their own local areas. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service was formed by the merger of eight regional fire services also on 1st April 2013. This led to decisions on policing and fire services being made in the central belt of Scotland rather than in the local communities they served. The results of this are plain to see. The police force is now in severe turmoil, with one disaster after another. Morale is low among the rank and file (and the officers). There is now a pronounced problem with gun crime in Scotland (especially in the Highlands). The resultant loss of local accountability that the creation of Police Scotland entailed, has led to the severe curtailment of services across Scotland, with the closure of five police control rooms and sixty-one public counters at police stations. Since the merger, Police Scotland has been racked with one failure and scandal after another, including deaths in custody and corruption, to add to the above-mentioned failure to provide an adequate service to the citizens of Scotland. Finally called to account for this series of disasters, Police Scotland’s Chief Constable, Stephen House, resigned in disgrace on 30th November 2015. His successors have kept up the low standard, and Police Scotland continues to perform badly. In a further development, a former top policeman who served for three decades in the former Strathclyde force before becoming Chief Constable of Grampian, Colin McKerracher, has voiced serious concerns that the creation of a single force would lead to the police being transformed into the puppets of the political elite at Holyrood (which currently means the SNP). Mr McKerracher warned the creation of Police Scotland\u0027s single force by the SNP in 2013 has led to ‘very unhealthy political influence’ and has raised fears of a ‘police state’. He added that the single national force had ‘ruined’ policing in Scotland and that the force should be split into four separate units, adding that it had become distanced from communities, as he condemned ‘political interference’ in policing, saying it removed a ‘tried and trusted’ three-way check and balance that previously existed. It has been a similar picture with the centralised Scottish Fire and Rescue service, with centralisation leading to the closure of fire services, including five fire control rooms, and inefficient service. The SNP-dominated Holyrood executive has systematically and categorically stripped powers from local communities. A prime example is the construction of onshore windfarms, which are very often rejected by local communities, only to be appealed and passed at the national level, to conform to national environmental policies, which are, in turn, led by the minority Greens.\u0026nbsp; And in the health service, the SNP-dominated Holyrood executive has imposed a new rule on health boards, capping the amount they can spend on capital works at hospitals without getting the permission of the SNP. This means that Holyrood now has centralised decisions on major works in 179 hospitals, rather than the decisions being made locally. Local councils have also been affected by SNP centralisation. They have had their funding and council tax levels decided centrally by the SNP in Holyrood, rather than decisions taken locally. To get access to revenue support, thirty-two councils have been forced to agree to let the council tax level be set centrally by the SNP executive. A financial disaster In addition to constitutional considerations, legislative devolution has been a monetary drain on UK and Scottish taxpayers. These costs include: The cost to run the entire Scottish Government The cost of running the Scottish Parliament itself Waste due to failed and mismanaged projects Waste due to failed tax policies Ultra-vires spending Cost of lost investment If Holyrood was abolished, the large amount of money saved could be employed in financing many other areas that need them much more, such as the NHS, housing, law and order, to name just three examples. Initial costs A first indication of the wayward expenditures and twisted priorities was the construction of the Scottish Parliament building itself. Initial estimates placed the costs of building Holyrood at £10-£40 million. The final cost came in at £414.4 million, a whopping 40 times higher than the lower estimate and 10 times larger than the higher one. The building also took considerably longer to construct than the architects predicted it would. It has also gained notoriety as one of the ugliest buildings in the UK. The Scottish Government The total operating costs budget for the Scottish Government in 2023-24 is £696.1 million. In the past five years, total spending on the Scottish Government has amounted to just over £3 billion. It is likely, given inflation and constantly increasing budgets, that the cost will amount to £10 billion over the next ten years. This extravagant figure is to implement decisions made by the Scottish Parliament that, prior to devolution, used to be made by a handful of staff in The Scottish Office. To put that into perspective: £10 Billion or £1 billion/year would cover the cost of 33,000 nurses or teachers ,every year, at an average annual pay of £30,000. In many cases, the Scottish Government is a solution in search of a problem. It has resulted in unnecessary duplication of services. Instead of adding a drop-down box for Scotland on a UK-wide IT system, the Scottish Government has insisted on building parallel systems, at huge expense to the taxpayer. This allows nationalists to create government departments that are under their control. In addition to increasing the size and cost of the Scottish Government workforce, The Government has created and funded a huge array of Scotland-only charities and quangos. Each of these is stuffed with loyal party members who provide government-friendly support. This does not happen in the rest of the UK.\u0026nbsp; For example, the Scottish Government’s unpopular Gender Recognition Reform Bill was promoted and supported by charities that support the Bill. Aside from the spending, this is yet another way that nationalism gains power, through the tentacles of government. — The Scottish Parliament itself currently costs £89.3 million a year to run: Running costs: £8.6 million (listed under ‘other expenditure’). Property costs: £9 million. MSP and other officeholders’ salaries: £12.6 million. Other staff salaries: £31.8 million. MSP expenses: £17 million. Costs for salaries and running the offices of the Commissioners and Ombudsman: £10.3 million. Would voters rather spend £12.6 million on MSPs salaries or hire 433 nurses or teachers? Overspending scandals and waste Added to the above, the SNP dominated devolved administration at Holyrood has wasted large sums of money on projects of doubtful value. One well-documented example is the CMAL ferry fiasco. Scotland’s ferries fiasco will cost £1.5 billion to fix, over ten years, for two vessels from state-controlled ferry operator CalMac, that are over five years late. One expert has tipped the final cost for the ferries alone to top £400 million, up from £97 million originally agreed. These huge costs come in the midst of brutal cuts facing public services, after ministers unveiled a spending plan that will slash more than £1 billion from key areas including councils and the police. Pretendy embassies Despite foreign policy and international trade/relations being reserved to the UK Government, and UK Government running UK embassies around the world, the Scottish Government has opened international hubs (read proto-Scottish embassies), which cost millions every year, in countries including Canada, China, America, France, Ireland, Germany and Belgium. Salaries, upkeep, day-to-day running and hospitality costs across the network of hubs amounts to £5,942,000 a year. They are led by Ken Thomson, the ­SNP’s Director-General for Constitution and External Affairs. Offices include a ­£2.5 million base in Brussels – the home of the European Union – which employs around 20 people, while the office in Ottawa, Canada, opened in 2018, had a budget of £570,000 for 2021-22, and has career civil servant Catriona Little, who was formerly with UK Dept for Trade and Investment, as office head. This massively expensive network of unnecessary hubs is yet another example of the cash drain that the SNP have caused during their years in power. Legal costs in pursuing ‘independence’ The SNP has also spent at least £20 million on constitutional vanity projects, such as agitating for a second independence referendum, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. Local authority spending cuts On the other side of the coin of wasteful spending, are cuts in areas that the Scottish Government does not favour, most notably local authorities. While the overall Scottish Government budget and the block grant has grown, the Scottish Government is not passing that growth to Scotland’s local authorities. The SNP has been told by local councils that it has to \u0027reset\u0027 the way it funds them, after Holyrood cut £937m from council funding. They accused the nationalist administration of having ‘neglected and mistreated’ Scotland’s local councils who have also warned they face real-term cuts to their non-ringfenced budgets of nearly £1 billion, over an eight-year period.\u0026nbsp; Pauline McNeill, who was Scottish Labour’s local government spokesperson, has pointed to research by her party that shows Holyrood has cut councils’ non-ringfenced revenue funding by £937.3 million in real terms, between 2013-14 and 2021-22, adding: Throughout its 14 years in government, the SNP has systematically undervalued, underfunded and under-appreciated Scotland’s local authorities. COSLA, the umbrella organisation that represents Scottish councils, has demanded that a new funding arrangement for local councils be set up, as the country emerges from the pandemic. COSLA has also warned that some authorities will be left out of pocket and will suffer even deeper cuts following the council tax freeze, with alarm raised that some councils will even need to raise the charge as they receive no funding from the Holyrood to cover the increases needed. Glasgow City Council officials have revealed £113 million of savings will have to be found up to 2025/26, while the city’s budget has been cut by 11% since 2013/14. During the same period, SNP-controlled Holyrood funding has increased by more than 3%. In a rare act of dissent, Susan Aitken, leader of the SNP-led Glasgow City Council said, after a leaked document, prepared by a cross-party group of Glasgow councillors and officials, proposed a cut of 800 teachers and earlier closing for primary schools, in an attempt to save £51 million from the education budget.\u0026nbsp; But what we cannot be is treated solely as a delivery vehicle for national priorities at the expense of local needs. Almost the entirety of the additional £550 million announced for local government in December has to be directed at national priorities. It did little or nothing for Glasgow’s budget gap, protecting the policies Ministers were elected on rather than the services local councils are expected to deliver. But it’s councillors who are accountable for decisions about local public services. Our call to remove the restrictions holding us back from setting local priorities and taking local decisions isn’t just about democracy and accountability, it’s about the very survival of those services at this critical time. Glasgow City Council’s budget needs to fund all of Glasgow’s services and so - with the greatest respect to colleagues at Holyrood - the decisions about it must and will be made here in Glasgow.’ Funding pressures are not isolated to Scotland’s cities, with the Highlands Council showing a £51 million budget gap until 2024, Angus Council highlighting a £11.3 budget gap and Argyll and Bute Council having to deal with a £6.7 million gap. Taxation In the 1997 Devolution referendum, 63.7% of voters agreed that the Scottish Assembly should have tax raising powers. The effects of differing taxation rates are now being felt, with Scots being taxed higher than any other part of the UK. Due to SNP tax policy over the last 11 years, the number of people on higher rate income tax, charged at 41%, has risen from 7% of all Scottish taxpayers to 17%. This has been done primarily by freezing tax thresholds.\u0026nbsp; The Scottish Fiscal Commission calculates that freezing the threshold for higher rate tax is costing someone on £60,000 more than £600 a year, rising above £1,300 a year, five years from now. So, by 2027-28, the Fiscal Commission is estimating that 697,000 Scots will be on the higher rate tax, up by 313,000 in only seven years. It’s not as though this extra taxation is bringing in a lot of extra income. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a financial think tank, said that, despite raising taxes, the Scottish Government received £200 million less than if the bands had been the same. This is an effect of\u0026nbsp; the ‘Laffer Curve’, which says that if taxes are too high, people will work harder to avoid them. Despite income tax rises equivalent to £500 million, the forecasts that weak growth in the tax base means revenues will be nearly £200 million lower this year than if income tax hadn’t been devolved. Increased personal taxes drive high earners, or young people with aspirations to higher earnings, out of Scotland, and are a major barrier to inward investment. Why would any global company’s executives choose to place a factory in Scotland, when it will subject them to higher taxes than in England? Has this Parliament had any achievements? It\u0027s no surprise that these schemes are so poorly thought out and managed. Of the SNP’s 29 ministers, few have any business experience. Not a single SNP Minister has ever worked in management. A prime example is Kate Forbes, who has two years junior accounting experience, yet until recently, was in charge of a £36 billion budget. It\u0027s also no surprise that when a governing party doesn\u0027t want devolution to work – only seeing it as a vehicle to independence, and promotes party politicians based on their ability to foment grievance, rather than their competence – that Scotland is in decline. When asked about the achievements of 14 years of Nationalist government, most supporters will claim ‘baby boxes’ and ‘free prescriptions’. Are those benefits worth the cost? They appear to forget that most of the ‘free’ services introduced by SNP controlled Holyrood are actually a benefit of being in the UK, as they are largely funded by the taxpayers in London and the South of England. The evidence is incontrovertible. The Scottish Government has been an expensive experiment, whose results are now clear and damning. It is populated by low-quality politicians, it is inherently wasteful, and the laws it has passed have, in the main, been rejected by voters and are mainly being used to provoke confrontation with the UK Government, through constitutional power grabs.\u0026nbsp; Until recently, nationalists, helped by a complacent UK Government and media appeasement, thought that independence was just a matter of time. But, as the SNP has collapsed in criminal investigation and financial scandal, the separatist myth of inevitability has shattered. Separatists can no longer push forward and the initiative is now firmly on the side of those who want to maintain the integrity of the UK. It is now time to reassess the failings of the ‘government’ and push back.

Pull up.","url":"/articles/pull-up-pull-up/","content":"Like many of us who now find ourselves locked inside for most of the day, I have been watching more movies than usual. A few nights ago, one struck me with its resonance to current Scottish politics. It was about an aircraft that, mid-flight, suffered a catastrophic malfunction to its tail assembly, causing it to roll over and enter a steep dive that inverted all of its controls; actions that would have previously lifted the nose of the aircraft would only push it down further. As the pilots fought the controls, a clear but plaintive mechanical voice repeats, \"Pull up. Pull up,\" as the plane hurtles to the ground, as if the pilots hadn\u0027t already realised the situation which they were now powerless to stop. The scene reminds me of the SNP in recent weeks, as their civil war, the Salmond trial, a failing vaccine rollout, an embarrassing and damaging economic assessment and general political failure all come to the fore.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Firstly, the firing of Joanna Cherry, the only competent and respected SNP MP in Westminster. A shameless political assasination was arranged in a desperate desire to remove a possible challenger, resulting in widespread condemnation. One SNP local branch reported losing 14% of its members in a single weekend due to this move, with reports of 50,000 people leaving the party. By all indications, Cherry has only just started on her warpath.\u0026nbsp; “Pull up. Pull up,” the alert warns, but the SNP pilots are pushing all the wrong buttons.\u0026nbsp; Secondly, the Salmond inquiry is now a complete farce, increasingly challenged by people both inside and outside the party. Separatists and the opposition have highlighted that a scandal of this magnitude would never be tolerated in London. Key evidence censored, lying witnesses, uncooperative courts and cover-up after cover-up.\u0026nbsp; It has become a festering and increasingly septic wound for the SNP as the days pass. In a single national newspaper there were four stories on the inquiry yesterday, three the day before that and four again the day before that. Each story chips away at the SNP\u0027s holier-than-thou image and the electorate\u0027s faith in them. We are now reaching what promises to be an eventful climax when Nicola Sturgeon, her husband and Alex Salmond appear within ten days of each other, each hell-bent on destroying the other. Whether the truth comes out or not, this public display of infighting will certainly damage the party.\u0026nbsp; “Pull up. Pull up,” the alert drones. But the pilots are fighting each other. Thirdly, the failing vaccine rollout. Much has been made of how Matt Hancock used the movie Contagion as a reason to buy more vaccine doses and as a source of ideas. Still, I feel that I speak for the vast majority of people here when I say, I don\u0027t care which movie he got the idea from, as long as it works. While the UK rockets ahead in our rollout, and as the EU stumbles from blunder to blunder with theirs, Scotland is falling behind as the arrogant SNP will not ask for help when they need it.\u0026nbsp; Their pride stopped them from asking for military assistance; their pride meant they would not admit they had got it wrong or that they had benefited from being in the UK\u0027s vaccine program. Their drive to centralise all power has meant that GPs are mired in endless red tape with policies and procedures that limit their access to vaccines and reduce the speed of the rollout. Make no mistake, the SNP are horrified at the UK\u0027s vaccine successes. It undermines their secessionist arguments, and puts the boot in the PR frenzy they intended to make of it. Imagine the endless statements, criticisms, and grandstanding we would have had to endure if the EU and UK fates were reversed.\u0026nbsp; \"Pull up. Pull up,\" the voice insists. But the pilots have decided to blame the malfunction on England. Fourthly, the LSE\u0027s damaging assessment that ‘independence’ would — only on trade matters and not considering the enormous costs associated with everything else —\u0026nbsp; be two to three times more economically damaging than Brexit. The SNP were quick to discredit the report, first attacking the report\u0027s methodology and then its authors, despite having championed the same institution\u0027s report on Brexit produced only a year earlier.\u0026nbsp; Apparently, the party’s amateur economists, who have no formal economic training to speak of, somehow know more than people with PhDs at one of the most prestigious academic institutions globally, with over a century of experience in dealing with economic assessments and planning.\u0026nbsp; Of course, this could all be resolved if the SNP would simply show us their reports. But they don\u0027t have any. The drivel they attempt to publish would be torn to shreds by anyone with the most rudimentary understanding of economics and common sense. For all the SNP\u0027s grandstanding on holding a referendum this year, they have not produced a single page about what a separated Scotland would be like.\u0026nbsp; \"Pull up. Pull up.\" The pilots could save the aircraft, but they’re ignoring the data. But it’s not just the pilots, take a look at the plane. It’s tired and worn out. For all its promises of social revolution, the SNP hasn\u0027t delivered on its talk. If a party cannot achieve its goals after 14 years in power, it is doubtful it ever will. Even prominent nationalists are describing the situation as feeling \"like the last days in the bunker”, a reference to Hitler’s last days, as he moved non-existent armies across nonsensical maps with totally unrealistic objectives, amid a mental breakdown.\u0026nbsp; People who have waited 14 years are losing faith that the SNP will ever deliver anything. Will the SNP get a majority in the next elections? Even favourable polling shows them nowhere near the strength they enjoyed in the runup to the last elections. It increasingly feels that our SNP pilots have heard the warnings, but rather than fight to save the passengers, they’re reaching for their (golden) parachutes.\u0026nbsp; Scotland has for centuries been a country of block voting. Once it was the liberals, then Labour, then the SNP. But each got complacent and arrogant and worn out, and was replaced. We are now merely watching history take its course again.\u0026nbsp; The plane is in a death spiral. The pilots are on the way out the back door. As it heads into the ground the passengers hear a quiet voice. \"Pull up. Pull up.\" Angus Robinson is a lecturer at a UK university.

Separatist polling in Scotland The idea that the nationalists have a mandate for independence from ANY election, Westminster, devolved executive (Holyrood) or local council is THE major fallacy of elections for Scottish constituencies. The fact is, that the SNP has NO MANDATE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND NEVER HAS, EVER. The bottom-line fact of UK Constitutional Law is that under the devolution \u0027settlement\u0027, a Holyrood election CANNOT deliver a mandate for independence, as the Constitution is a reserved matter, irrespective of what\u0027s in a party\u0027s manifesto, or that independence is their reason for existing. The Scottish Parliament can deliver a mandate for a party to form a devolved administration at Holyrood and look after Scotland\u0027s day-to-day matters ONLY (i.e. all matters that aren\u0027t reserved for Westminster\u0027s consideration), but that\u0027s all. But let\u0027s indulge the SNP and take a very close look at its claims to have a mandate for independence through receiving a majority of votes from the public in elections (Westminster, Holyrood or local council). The plain truth is that the SNP has neve received a majority of votes from the entire registered Scottish electorate (4,243,800 people), just a simple majority of those that did actually vote. Added to this, that simple majority has never even reached 50% of those that voted, and indeed usually came in at around a third of the total registered electorate. Winning a majority of seats in Holyrood, and a majority of seats in Scotland at Westminster doesn\u0027t give the SNP any mandate for independence when they only represent around a third of the total registered electorate, and where the vast majority of opinion polls on independence in Scotland continue to show a majority for Scotland staying in the Union. And, of course, the largest poll ever conducted on Scottish independence, the Scottish Independence Referendum of 2014, had 84.6% turnout and was decisively won by pro-UK voters, with 55.3% voting against the break up of the UK and 44.7% voting for, despite constant lies from separatists and the media that the vote was ‘close’.\u0026nbsp; Separatist polling in England There has been talk, from both Scottish nationalists and some English nationalists as well as pro-English Parliament advocates, that the English are disaffected with the Union, and either want to break it up, don\u0027t care if it does break up, or want an English Parliament. The facts contradict this assertion and show the opposite is true in reality.\u0026nbsp; For example, a major poll, conducted by Panelbase, which polled 3,981 people across the UK between June 18th and July 2nd, 2021, determined that 56% of voters in England believe there should not be another Scottish referendum in the next few years, and 54% want Scotland to remain in the UK.\u0026nbsp; Several other opinion polls in England have also found that there is a majority for staying in the Union. For instance, nearly half of people (48%) said they considered themselves British above any other identity, with only 3 in 10 disagreeing. British identity was the strongest in England (51%) then Wales (46%). This conclusively shows that the English nationalist assertion that the English now want to break up the Union is not backed up by the facts. 53% of those who voted to remain in the EU and 47% of people who backed leaving in the 2016 referendum also saw themselves first and foremost as British. A total of 56% said the UK remaining united was \u0027very important to me\u0027, with only 15% disagreeing. Fewer than 1 in 5 (19%) of people said the UK would be better off if Scotland voted for independence, with 42% disagreeing. Nearly 4 out of 10 (39%) opposed a second Scottish independence referendum, with only 32% saying one should be held. Despite Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s strategy of trying to annoy the English so much that they would let us whining Scots go, a majority of English voters still understand that Scotland is integral to the UK. In the 2021 Census, we find that petty nationalism is on the decline, with The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Census data on national identity in England and Wales showing that English-only identity is decreasing, while British identity increases: (2). More than half of the usually resident population of England and Wales, 54.8% or 32.7 million people, indicated that they were of solely ‘British’ national identity, a rise of 35.8% since the 2011 Census.\u0026nbsp; Conversely, the opposite trend was witnessed in the ‘English only’ category, which fell massively by 42.8% from 57.7% in 2011 to 14.9% (32.4 million people) in 2021. Regarding English identity in England specifically: 56.8% of people selected a ‘British’ only identity (an increase from 19.2% in the 2011 Census). 15.3% of individuals selected an ‘English’ only identity (a decrease from 60.4% in 2011). Note: The SNP in Scotland decided to run a census separately from the rest of the UK and inevitably, it turned into an embarrassing (for the nationalists) show of incompetence, in how NOT to do it. Initial results (pertaining to population size) were released in September this year, but the results relating to national identity will not be available until the summer of 2024. Consequently, no analysis and comment can be made at this juncture. This article will be updated at that time. Separatist polling in Wales A comprehensive new survey has determined that the overwhelming majority of Welsh people reject independence. The \u0027State of the nation Survey\u0027 is conducted annually by YouGov for WalesOnline and asks thousands of people what they think of Welsh independence and Mark Drakeford\u0027s devolved Labour administration.\u0026nbsp; The major finding of this survey is that the vast majority of people in Wales reject independence. In 2022, 7,510 people responded to this question and of these, 63% said they didn\u0027t think Wales should be independent of the UK, with only 28% saying it should. This is a notable diminution of support for independence, which stood at 30% in this survey the previous year. In 2022, to the question \u0027How well do you think the Welsh Government serves the interests of Wales?\u0027, 49% of the 7533 responses thought that Labour leader Mark Drakeford\u0027s devolved Welsh administration served the interests of Wales \u0027not very well\u0027, compared with 28% that answered \u0027somewhat well\u0027 and 22% that said, \u0027very well\u0027. When asked \u0027Is enough (or too much) devolved to Wales?\u0027 there were 7,501 responses. Both yes and no received 38% each, with a slight 23 votes in favour of \u0027too much\u0027 and to the question \u0027What single thing could be done which would make a big difference to Wales\u0027 future?\u0027, \u0027abolishing devolution\u0027 was a featured reply. Separatist polling in Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, a major new academic survey has found that over three-quarters of those who do not vote in elections support remaining in the UK. The study, carried out by Social Market Research of 2000 people for the University of Liverpool questions the assumption that how people vote in elections is necessarily reflective of how those who turn out in any potential referendum to remove Northern Ireland from the UK, will vote. In a report setting out the findings, the lead author of the research project, Professor Jon Tonge, said: \u0027In terms of a border poll, election results may be a less accurate a guide to the desire for reunification, especially when it is considered that 76.9% of non-voters who stated a preference are pro-Union.\u0027 Overall, the survey found 53.5% of respondents support remaining in the UK, rising to 65% when those who said they don\u0027t know, expressed other preferences or refused to answer are excluded. These findings are backed up by another major poll, which found that a clear and substantial majority of people want Northern Ireland to remain in the UK. \u0027The Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey\u0027 (NILT), was carried out between October 8th and December 8th 2022 and surveyed 1292 adults aged 18 or over. The polling was organised by both the University of Ulster and Queen\u0027s University, Belfast. NILT has determined that just under 53% of voters in Northern Ireland would opt to stay with the UK in a referendum on unification with the Republic, but that less than a third of those surveyed backed unification and that support for Northern Ireland remaining in the Union was popular across the communities, with substantial support for staying in the UK coming from Roman Catholics. 9% of those surveyed fell into the \u0027undecided\u0027 category when asked if Northern Ireland should unify with the Republic or remain in the UK. Based upon the poll\u0027s results, even if all the undecideds eventually decided to opt for reunification, the pro-unification figure would still only be 39%. It was also determined that a majority of those who profess no religion also support staying in the UK (48%) with 32% of those in the same category backing unification. Dr Peter Shirlow, a social demographer and head of Liverpool University\u0027s Institute of Irish Studies has stated that the NILT findings were consistent with other polls showing a cross-community majority against a united Ireland, adding: There have been at least six household surveys now conducted since 2016 by the University of Liverpool, Queen\u0027s University Belfast and the Ulster Unionist. All these surveys show majority support for remaining in the UK, a significant share of Roman Catholics who support remaining in the UK and no growth in the very small proportion of Protestants who want Irish unification. These robust and rigorous surveys clearly indicate there is no evidence that would support the calling of a border poll. Dr Shirlow has also described calls for a border poll and Irish unity from nationalists as: \u0026nbsp;a fast-growing souffle, given that when you see survey after survey showing a united Ireland is not imminent then you have to conclude, there may be something hollow in the middle. He went on to point out that the NILT poll was conducted at a time that should have been \u0027an optimum moment\u0027 for those \u0027seeking Irish unification\u0027, stating: Brexit, the protocol and the massive effort made by civic nationalist groups has led to a small growth in those who support unification, yet this was supposed to be the game changer…If you take out those who do not express an opinion, then we are looking at 65% for the union and 36% for Irish unity.’ The 2021 Census also shows a clear majority for British identity (3): 42.8% (814, 600) of people living in NI described themselves as ‘British’ (i.e. they identified with the UK mainland). 33.3% (634, 600) who said they were ‘Irish’ (identifying with the Irish Republic). The conclusion is straightforward: Across the entire UK, the objective facts, in the form of an actual referendum, opinion polls and surveys, show there is a consensus that UK citizens reject separatism and want to keep the UK together. Witht he decline of the SNP and nationalism in scotland, those number will only increase. And that is a reason to be cheerful about the future of the UK.

Part 1 – How we got here Part 2 – Power Grabs, Waste \u0026amp; Scandal The first part of this series covered how legislative devolution grew from a concept into the reality of the Scottish Assembly, and talked about how, rather than acting as a bulwark against nationalism, it has become a UK Government-funded vehicle for nationalism and constitutional division. The second part of the series talked about the costs of running the Parliament, and its history of waste and scandal and asked if this money, time and energy could be spent more wisely. Beyond an honest discussion of the value of the Parliament itself, it is necessary to have an honest discussion about alternatives, rather than the knee-jerk responses to the issue that have been common up to now. Increasing dissatisfaction Surveys in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have determined that disillusionment with their respective parliaments is increasing as their manifest failure to improve the living and working conditions of ordinary citizens or provide good governance, becomes ever more obvious. The most recent survey that asked if The Scottish Parliament should be abolished was conducted by YouGov in 2021. It delivered the following results: Yes: 20% No: 65% Don’t know: 10% Would not vote: 3% As expected, those who voted Yes in the 2014 election (83%), and SNP voters (91%), are those most likely to want to retain the Scottish Parliament, followed by Labour voters (65%). 59% of conservatives would have voted to abolish it. However, in this survey, 32% of those who voted No in 2014 would not abolish the Parliament.\u0026nbsp; If not at a regional parliament, then where do voters in favour of abolishing the devolved executives think decisions impacting their communities ought to be made?\u0026nbsp; Around half of those in favour of abolishing the Scottish and Welsh parliaments think that political decisions should be taken by the UK government, while around a third think that such power ought to be devolved further toward their local communities (administrative devolution). When asked ‘who is best placed to make decisions for your community’, 40% of Conservatives think that the UK Government should make decisions, 15% think the Scottish Government is best, and 37% think Local Government should do so. In the case of Labour, 11% think the UK Government is best placed, 49% think the Scottish Government is best placed, 31% of Labour thinking that local authorities are best placed to do so. However, the 2021 survey does not take into account: Recent events, including the criminal investigation of the SNP The resignation of Nicola Sturgeon The uncovering of various scandals in the Scottish parliament A resurgent Labour that would\u0026nbsp; increase Labour supporters’ trust in the UK Government Campaigns by third-party groups to educate voters on the issue Education on the various alternatives to abolition What needs to be done Any reformed system needs to have concrete aims. At a minimum, these should include: Reducing constitutional conflict Improving resource allocation Ensuring that funding is delivered to where it is needed effectively Lessening waste Decentralisation from Edinburgh Tax harmonisation across the UK First, more accountability\u0026nbsp; The years of ‘devolve and forget’ have proven a disaster. Given the deliberate flouting of their devolved remit and the incompetence of SNP controlled Holyrood in framing new laws and accounting for exceptionally large sums of money given to them by the UK Government, at a minimum, the devolved administrations need to be more visibly accountable to the central government.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The UK Government must make it clear that if the devolved legislatures don’t operate in compliance with the various laws governing the legislative devolution ‘settlement’, then strict sanctions will be taken against them. A simple way to improve legislative devolution is to set up a committee at Westminster that has full legal oversight to scrutinise the actions of the Scottish administration. This remit should include all legislation produced by the Parliament, including how it disperses funds given to it by the UK Government, and should include the ability to demand a full audit trail. The committee should also hold the power, under law, to demand an explanation for any discrepancies uncovered and recommend action, such as prosecution, to the appropriate authorities. This committee should also have the ability to exercise a veto on all proposed legislation from the devolved executives. Once a proposed bill has been published at any of the devolved legislatures, it would be passed to the committee, which would then spend as long as necessary looking at the bill’s details to see if there are any issues with it. If problems are found, they should be listed and the bill passed back to its originating legislature for reconsideration, with the necessary information that has been uncovered on its deficiencies, so that they can be corrected. When the bill has been adjusted, it could be forwarded back to the committee for reconsideration.\u0026nbsp; If the new version of the bill is judged, after further scrutiny, to have corrected the issues listed previously, it can receive Royal Assent and pass onto the statute book, becoming a new law. If it still has deficiencies, these should be listed again and the bill, plus a list of the new deficiencies, sent back for further adjustment. There should be no limit on how many times a bill can be considered and adjusted. The most important factor is not the length of time taken to consider new legislation, but its compliance with constitutional law – and its quality. There are signs that the net is tightening. Scotland Office minister Lord Offord of Garvel recently said in a debate at the House of Lords that, though devolved administrations can promote certain aspects of their part of the UK internationally (such as cultural events), they have to remain within the scope of their devolved remit and cannot discuss reserved matters, like the UK Constitution, trade or foreign affairs and the SNP has breached the law by discussing these matters with foreign governments. He says these breaches of constitutional law have come to the attention of the UK Government, which now plans to strictly monitor the activities of the SNP in this respect ‘very closely’. This is definitely a move in the right direction. This is a sensible approach that ensures the SNP (and the other anti-UK nationalists) stop abusing their devolved remit.\u0026nbsp; But this still does not address the underlying problem. Devolution is the problem, not who runs it Shouldn’t we reform, rather than abolish? Devolution has enabled the SNP to rise to dominance at Holyrood, displacing Labour, and to use the apparatus of ‘government’ as a platform to advance the cause of breaking up the UK. If there was no Holyrood, the SNP simply wouldn’t be in anything like the position in which they are now to promote independence.\u0026nbsp; Before the introduction of legislative devolution, all three anti-UK nationalist parties were just fringe extremists contained by the 600 or so other Unionist MP’s in the House of Commons, who could simply vote down any nationalist attempts at getting a referendum, irrespective of how many MPs they had. Legislative devolution destroyed the checks and balances on extremist parties and greatly enhanced their ability to undemocratically force their agenda on their part of the UK, against the will of the majority. One only needs to look at how the extremist and electorally unpopular Scottish Greens have been able to use the SNP’s desire for a majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament, to impose their will on the SNP and the population of Scotland. Effectively, a minority of Green list MSPs are propping up a minority SNP administration to impose their extremist anti-business and gender policies against the wishes of the majority of Scots, who did not vote for either party. This extremism also affects the entire UK, as the minority SNP, supported by the minority Greens, try to subvert UK laws, such as the Scotland Act and UK equalities law. Some people, including a number of pro-UK voters and politicians, argue that devolution would work if the SNP weren’t in charge at Holyrood, but this isn’t the case, as they will never give up on pursuing independence. So long as Holyrood exists, and there is a chance that they can get back into power again, they will just eternally pursue the neverendum, pushing for one poll on independence after another, until they get the result they want. We can see this in the SNP’s last leadership contest, where Ash Regan said that a result of 50%+1 of the votes and seats for pro ‘independence’ parties in any Holyrood or UK General Election, would mean that she would start independence preparations with the UK Government automatically. Red meat for the indy hardcore, with scant disregard for the Supreme Court’s ruling that the Scottish executive has no competence on constitutional issues. Tam Dalyell’s prescience has been vindicated on legislative devolution. It is the process of legislative devolution, its mere existence, that has led to the current constitutional crisis faced by the United Kingdom today. A system that can be hijacked by nationalists is, by its very nature, one that is broken. Voting out the SNP can only be a short-term measure to prevent them from forcing another referendum to be held in the near future. The only viable way to stop this endless cycle is to get rid of the mechanism that enables nationalists to pursue their independence agenda, against the will of the majority of Scots, that most opinion polls continue to show, who don’t want it — devolution itself. Administrative devolution A viable, durable constitutional settlement for the UK should encompass the following principles: The UK is a single (unitary) country, not a loose confederation of sovereign nation states, as the SNP (and even some pro-Union advocates) assert. All resources and sovereignty are pooled for the benefit of everybody, in all parts of the UK. Sovereignty is invested solely in Westminster, which functions as the common UK Parliament with common UK laws. Power over purely Scottish affairs should be localised.\u0026nbsp; Anything that concerns the UK as a whole should be within the remit of Westminster. Tax harmonisation, the removal of different bands and tax rates, to be replaced with standard tax rates and bands across the UK. This can be achieved by a process of administrative devolution in which authority over Scottish matters is devolved to local councils, working with a revived Scottish Office, along with individuals, such as the Secretary of State for Scotland. This way, power and democracy are kept localised to the constituent parts of the UK, and the integrity of the UK is 100% guaranteed as there are no devolved legislatures (Holyrood, the Welsh ‘parliament’ and Stormont) through which modern aggressive nationalism (the SNP, IRA/Sinn Fein plus the SDLP and Plaid Cymru) can pursue independence – the major intrinsic flaw in the kind of legislative devolution we have now, and the undeniable result of its introduction in Scotland. This is not, therefore, simply the re-centralization of all power in London. It is an authentic pro-UK principle. Administrative devolution has the great advantage, over the legislative variety, that it spreads decision making out to local areas without centralising it in London or Edinburgh. It enables local people, who know what’s best for their own locale, to make decisions, as opposed to the centralising tendency of legislative devolution that tends to take power and decision making away from local people, thus putting it in the hands of a far away central government. Administrative devolution offers a viable alternative. It poses no threat to the integrity of a unitary United Kingdom and can’t be used to break up the UK. It does not devolve any legislative power (i.e. legislative authority) to the constituent parts of the United Kingdom or need the setting up of elected political structures such as parliaments or assemblies. It delegates decision making (i.e. administrative) authority to official organisations (like the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices), local government (such as councils) or individuals (such as the Secretaries of State for Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland). It is fair, organisationally efficient and costs less than the legislative variant. One of the earliest questions devolution brought up was on the role of Scotland’s MPs, a debate we will not go into here, other than to say that in an administrative devolution system, these MPs would have a potential role in the scrutiny of parliamentary bills that affect Scotland only, possibly by creating a Scottish Grand Committee. This would ensure that the few Scotland-wide issues would be dealt with by Scots elected representatives. The above are just some of a host of options on how to better organise Scotland’s administration, ranging from full abolition to reforms that specifically target specific areas of concern. How to repeal? It is often asserted in various quarters (and not always by the usual anti-UK nationalist suspects) that legislative devolution is, or should be, a permanent part of the UK Constitution. Even the so-called ‘Conservative and Unionist Party’ is guilty of this. David Cameron said he wanted to make legislative devolution permanent and inserted a clause in the 2016 Scotland Act that asserted unequivocally that the UK Government accepted the permanence of legislative devolution. His successors have also publicly stated, on more than one occasion, that they are committed to supporting the continued existence of legislative devolution. Pro-legislative devolutionists argue that it is impossible to abolish legislative devolution as it has existed for twenty plus years now and so is too deeply entrenched to be scrapped. Time is not a factor that comes into consideration under UK Constitutional Law. If that was the case, we could never repeal old laws that have become outdated. David Cameron appears to have misunderstood, or deliberately misrepresented, the Parliamentary sovereignty principle of the UK Constitution: No Parliament can be bound by any previous Parliament or pass an act that will bind a future Parliament. No other body has the power to override or set aside an Act of Parliament. and The doctrine of implied repeal is a concept in constitutional theory which states that where an Act of Parliament or an Act of Congress (or of some other legislature in a common law system) conflicts with an earlier one, the later Act takes precedence and the conflicting parts of the earlier Act becomes legally inoperable. Under the UK Constitution, any law passed during the sitting of one Parliament can be repealed by a subsequent Parliament, irrespective of any clauses inserted in it. It is also specious to assert that devolution is too deeply entrenched to be scrapped, for the same reason. If we can repeal a law from centuries ago for certain reasons, then we can certainly do so to one from around twenty years ago. The UK is a unitary (single) country in which the House of Commons (HoC)\u0026nbsp; may devolve power over certain matters to any part(s) of itself, but no sovereignty is transferred to the devolved legislature – it remains entirely and solely with the HoC. The difference between a central government and a federal government is that the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the grace of the central government of the unitary whole. As such, they may be unilaterally revoked with a simple change in the law that repeals the Parliamentary acts that set them up in the first place. If a political party includes abolition of the devolved legislatures and their replacement with the administrative variant of devolution in its manifesto for a UK General Election, and won that election on a manifesto pledge to abolish legislative devolution, then that would give it a cast-iron democratic mandate to do so. A pledge to hold a referendum on abolishing legislative devolution, if they won the election, would impart a similarly cast-iron democratic mandate to do so (the current constitutional settlement was set up after Tony Blair’s New Labour Government won the 1997 General Election on a manifesto commitment to hold referenda on devolution in Scotland, Wales and NI, so it’s fair and consistent to abolish that settlement with a similar method). Once a future government has won a mandate for the abolition of legislative devolution through a general election victory based on a manifesto promise to abolish legislative devolution, the path to ending legislative devolution is straightforward and clear. Under UK Constitutional Law, all that is required to end the existence of the devolved legislatures is to introduce an act into parliament that repeals the original acts that set up legislative devolution in the first place, and that would be it – no more Holyrood. There is a clear procedure to implement the abolition of legislative devolution. All that’s needed to implement that procedure is to first get majority democratic consent to do it. Building a movement The anti-devolution revolution is here. Irrespective of whether you agree with Brexit or not, an examination of the processes that drove Brexit and which are currently driving attitudes towards legislative devolution, reveal striking similarities. In 1991, an obscure Cambridge academic, Dr Alan Sked (a Scot) founded a political party called ‘The Anti-Federalist League’, later to become ‘The United Kingdom Independence Party’, UKIP, with an aim to get the UK to withdraw from the then European Economic Community (today’s EU). Sked and his early followers, were vehemently sneered at and derided by this country’s chattering classes as holding extremist views. In June 2016, the long journey of the Eurosceptics, largely led by an initially small, but gradually larger, UKIP, triumphed after all those years of campaigning, leading to the majority of the UK backing leaving the EU in the referendum of that year. There are now no longer any MEPs in the UK, and they are not missed. Just as the Eurosceptics employed persistence and determination in the face of intense hostility from all corners, especially the Establishment, people who are sceptical of legislative devolution’s benefits to the UK, the constitutional crisis it has created, and the clear and present danger it presents to the Union – the Devosceptics – must show similar persistence and determination in pursuing the goal of securing the existence of the UK into the future by persevering on a path towards reuniting our country by consistently presenting the positive case for keeping the UK together. Like Brexit, it won’t happen quickly, but for those who believe in the sovereignty of the UK, the result is definitely worth the effort. The same process can happen with abolishing the devolved legislatures. Natural conservatives are already aligned against Holyrood, while Labour voters can be persuaded, especially when Labour returns to power at Westminster.\u0026nbsp; But it is one thing for people to know that devolution is not providing value, and another for them to actively speak up against it and to join a movement. If the positive case for abolition is consistently and assiduously put to the public (with objective empirical evidence to support it), it will gradually be recognized for what it is – the truth – by the majority of the public in the UK. Maybe one day in the not so distant future, the UK will stand on the brink of ‘Reunification Day’ as this nation becomes entirely whole again, no longer fractured by legislative devolution. It should also be noted that proposing abolition as a strategy is more effective than simply calling for reform. MSPs will pay lip service to reforms until they realise that their jobs are on the line.\u0026nbsp; Conclusion Save the UK? Kill nationalism off forever? Almost twenty five years ago, legislative devolution’s proponents promised Scotland that legislative devolution would herald the beginning of a bright new era of strong, competent and vigorous government. Reality has been completely different. Legislative devolution has been an extremely expensive flop. It has completely failed to provide better governance for the citizens of the devolved parts of the UK, in terms of improving their living and working conditions or general governance terms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; What’s more, it has enabled modern aggressive nationalism, as personified by the SNP in Scotland, to rise to power in Holyrood and use it as a platform to promote independence with considerably enhanced ability. Far from ‘killing nationalism stone dead’, it has actually provided them with a massively enhanced platform to pursue their separatist agenda. This has provoked a severe constitutional crisis that is a very real, clear and present danger to the existence of the United Kingdom as a unified nation. The SNP is monomaniacal in its pursuit of independence/reunification and will never give up trying to force separation on their part of the UK. Consequently, as long as devolved legislatures exist, there is always the possibility that they will regain power at a later date and start pushing for independence again, plunging Scotland again into the neverendum. The system was poorly thought out and is unredeemable. The only viable option to maintain the UK is to get rid of the mechanism that enabled twenty five years of constitutional failings, incompetence and waste – legislative devolution. All those who desire to maintain the UK should begin to vigorously and robustly strive to advocate, at every turn, the case for abolishing Holyrood to those in power and to the wider public, as a matter of extreme urgency.

In a recent commentary, ‘Ireland’s past is not Scotland’s future’, Damien Scott talks about his upbringing in a mixed Catholic-Protestant home. Damien says he is now an atheist and that as religious belief has dwindled in Scotland, politics has replaced it as an article of faith. In effect, he says politics is Scotland’s new religion. However, as a practising Catholic, I believe my faith does play a fundamental role in shaping my political beliefs, including my view that Scotland is better off as part of the United Kingdom, and that the world is better off because of the United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp; Before I begin my reasoning, it is important to note that my views are not the views of the Catholic Church as the Church does not take a stance on the constitutional debate occurring in our country currently. Other Catholics can follow Church teaching and believe Scotland is better off as an independent country. The views expressed are thus mine, and mine alone.\u0026nbsp; In conversation with people who question why I can identify as both a Catholic and a believer in our United Kingdom, they tend to highlight three areas where they believe the UK operates contrary to Catholic social teaching.\u0026nbsp; The first of these is history, with a strong focus on the British Empire and the treatment towards Catholics throughout British history. Of course, these are both things that I disagree with.\u0026nbsp; To quote St. Augustine of Hippo, “To make war and to extend the realm by crushing other peoples, is good fortune in the eyes of the wicked”. The expansion of empire for the luxury of earthly power and earthly riches is not a characteristic of good men or good government, thus, the British Empire is not something which I believe Brits should look back on with pride.\u0026nbsp; The treatment towards Catholics in parts of British history is also something which gives me much discomfort. I find it horrifying that people were persecuted simply because of their faith, such as the martyrs St. Thomas More and St. John Ogilve. Yet, I look at our United Kingdom today and I can tell we are learning from our history. British identity is no longer symbolised by the Empire, nor is it symbolised with anti-Catholicism. I am pretty vocal about my Catholic faith, and it is only on the rare occasion have I been shouted at for abuse on the grounds of my religion, and on the majority of occasions that people have aimed abuse at me on the grounds of my faith, it has been from a secular angle rather than an anti-Catholic angle. Just as we have discovered from the debate surrounding statues, history is complicated. Good people do bad things, and some bad people do good things. We have a duty to learn from our past to ensure that atrocities that have occurred are not repeated. From my experience of the UK in the 21st century, Britain is learning, thus allowing me as Catholic to support Scotland’s place in our United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp; The second area where people have questioned me about my support of the United Kingdom is poverty, arguing that the United Kingdom has one of the highest poverty rates in the world. Whilst I do believe that policy adjustments can be made to ensure a higher level of economic prosperity for those on the lowest incomes, I do not support the conclusion that breaking up one of the world’s largest economies will help address poverty levels. To the contrary, I believe such a decision would make poverty levels worse in Scotland.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Paraphrasing Pope Benedict XVI, Catholics have a duty not to harden their hearts to the pain and sufferings of others. We have a duty to look out for the poor, and in Christian charity, treat everyone the way that we would like to be treated ourselves.\u0026nbsp; The partnership of our United Kingdom allows us to do this across the island of Great Britain, as well as in Northern Ireland. In the 1980’s, for example, Scotland’s economy was doing well due to the newly developed oil \u0026amp; gas industry, resulting in Scots paying more tax than they received in public spending, as public spending was being directed to places with slower economic activity.\u0026nbsp; Fast forward to the present day, and Scots receive over £11,000 in public spending per head, compared to being taxed less than £10,000 per head. In other words, due to Scotland’s slower economic activity, it is the dividend of being part of the United Kingdom which is permitting the same wealth to remain in the country.\u0026nbsp; There can be no doubt, therefore, that Scotland would be a poorer country per head of population if we were to leave the United Kingdom today. Of course, one may argue that Scotland would have been richer per head of population if we left the UK in the 1980’s, but such a policy would result in those in poorer areas of the UK becoming even poorer due to the removal of the union dividend. The answer of making ourselves poorer or making others poorer are not Christian in my eyes.\u0026nbsp; The third objection that people raise is localism, arguing that the union has resulted in productivity being sucked into the South East of England, leaving Scottish industry behind. I fully support localism as it promotes community, and would endorse any move to increase the power and responsibilities of local councils across Scotland.\u0026nbsp; The problem we have in Scotland, however, is that we have a Government in Edinburgh soaking up powers from local Government, taking powers away from communities. Making matters worse, the Scottish Government is using these powers ineffectively, stifling innovation, prosperity, and entrepreneurism in the process.\u0026nbsp; By slowing economic growth and making Scotland the highest tax place in the UK, it is no surprise that industry is leaving to the most prosperous part. This is not the fault of the UK, the UK Government, or businesses themselves. Responsibility lies at the door of the Scottish Government, a party which has controlled our economy for 13 years.\u0026nbsp; Devolution was introduced to allow localism to flourish, but devolution is not Holyrood sucking up powers from local Government. True devolution is giving back control to local Governments, so people across Scotland are empowered, and local politicians are accountable. Central to localism is delivering the economic conditions to allow local businesses to strive, something the current devolution permits but is not being delivered by the current administration.\u0026nbsp; One of the most wonderful things about our United Kingdom is the lack of codified constitution, permitting our country to be agile and flexible. Though we are far from perfect, we have a structure where localism and economic growth can be achieved, and through the right education system, we can continue to learn from our past so that we do not repeat our mistakes.\u0026nbsp; As a Catholic, this makes me confident that remaining an integral part of the United Kingdom is the right path for Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Bona Fide,\u0026nbsp; James Bundy\u0026nbsp; Help us fight back Next May there’s going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nationalists will use it tocontinue to\u0026nbsp;agitate for a disastrous referendum.

Nicola Sturgeon hasn’t taken responsibility. She has not fired anyone. The whole of Scotland is talking about her collusion, corruption and cover-up, instead of health, education and jobs. She must resign so the country can move on. The campaign message — #ResignSturgeon — is part of an ongoing grassroots hashtag campaign on Twitter that has had hundreds of thousands of retweets and responses and regularly appears on Twitter’s ‘trending’ lists of the social network’s most popular hashtags. The campaign is funded in part by donations to a crowdfunder, run by The Majority, that has raised almost £6500 to date. https://donorbox.org/billboard-campaign Mark Devlin of The Majority: We represent the silent majority of people in Scotland, who are angry and frustrated by Nicola Sturgeon’s shenanigans bringing international shame on Scotland.The Scottish public deserve a Parliament and First Minister above reproach and want the Scottish Government to focus on health, education, jobs and the pandemic. Instead we have a First Minister misleading parliament, breaking the ministerial code and withholding information from an inquiry into her government’s unlawful, unfair and biased actions against Alex Salmond, all while totally neglecting her day job. Alan Sutherland from Scotland Matters: We call on the First Minister to do the right thing for Scotland: resign and let us focus on recovery from the pandemic. She has done great damage to our country and Parliament’s reputation, here and abroad, by conducting an undignified, very public dispute with her former SNP colleague, while preventing the Salmond enquiry from seeing evidence that is crucial to a proper investigation.

Run away!","url":"/articles/run-away-run-away/","content":"On Thursday, I read an article by Adam Morris in the Independent (If Boris Johnson wants to save the Union, he should stay far away from Scotland) which seems to encapsulate the appeasement and cowardice of the so-called Scottish Conservative \u0026amp; Unionist Party. So, I thought I’d go through it line-by-line and highlight the loserthink it embodies.\u0026nbsp; Morris starts by trying to claim that the departure of Michelle Ballantyne is a gain for the party. Ms Ballantyne’s departure sparked accusations from a pretty vocal minority that the party was abandoning Scotland’s one million Leave voters, and should really be embracing Boris Johnson’s premiership rather than being so publicly ashamed of it. A vocal minority. That’s The Majority, our readers, and this article he’s talking about. The one where I argue that, when faced with a choice between the real thing and a weak substitute, people will always choose the real thing. But, outside of this publication, it’s quite something to claim that one million Leave voters are not important. In fairness to the now independent South Scotland MSP, she has being (sic) saying this proudly and repeatedly since her own leadership bid at the start of the year. But she is as wrong now as she was then.\u0026nbsp; At this point we’ll note that Mr Morris ran Douglas Ross\u0027s ‘leadership campaign’. And who was the person who was most uneasy about Ross being anointed? Michelle Ballantyne, who after being cut out of the leadership contest, said she agreed to support Ross on the understanding he leads a “Boris backing, Brexit positive, anti-nat party”. In other words, a party that follows the same policies as the UK party. How is that working out? If the Scottish Conservatives want to have a successful Holyrood election next May, it’s not the pro-Brexit working-class vote it has to persuade. It’s the sandstone-abiding, pro-EU middle-class voters who backed the party in 2016 and 2017 because they wanted the UK to stay together, but couldn’t stomach the idea of a hard Brexit or, in some cases, any Brexit at all. Let me make this as plain as I can. If you want to be a LibDem, join that party. The Conservatives got an 80-seat majority by promising to deliver Brexit. They got that majority because they tapped into working-class resentment from Leave voters that they were being ignored by a political and media elite that constantly denigrated them and took them for granted. The very resentment that many Scottish conservative voters feel right now.\u0026nbsp; Having been head of media for the party in key elections from the 2014 independence referendum to the 2019 general election... Credibility alert! Morris’s media management for the Tories nearly ended in disastrous separation. He helped lose the Scottish Elections in 2016 and had a disastrous General Election in 2019. And we’re supposed to listen to him now?\u0026nbsp; An example of how he failed: In my local constituency, Lanark and Hamilton East, the gap between the SNP and Conservative candidate in the 2017 General Election, was just 300 votes. But, in 2019, did I see a single social media ad, poster or anything at all in this area that would have swung the vote?\u0026nbsp; Nope. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Nothing to get me excited to tell people the Tories were worth voting for. The lack of promotion was so obvious I wrote a note to an MSP offering my services as a social media ad expert (part of my ‘day job’). I didn’t expect to hear back, but I did expect to see some more ads. Nothing changed. The seat was lost by 5187 votes.\u0026nbsp; Meanwhile, Boris got an 80-seat majority. The Scottish Conservative Party’s policies, and the media produced based on those policies, failed to shift the needle in Scotland, yet Morris is now trying to say that Boris is the problem? Mate, you’re the problem. I could see the type of people who were turning away. Candidates right across Scotland reported knocking on well-to-do doors of people they knew had voted No and for the Conservatives in recent years, but would simply not entertain either the idea of Johnson or Brexit. Again: why the focus on the “well-to-do”? In any case, this is actually false, because Conservative Remainers are generally still loyal to the party, with less than 10% being ‘Strong Leavers’. This is proven by the 2019 General Election result, where Tories —\u0026nbsp; as I will continue to mention throughout this piece — gained an 80-seat majority. Conservative voters are willing to suck it up for the sake of the party. As we all know, SNP gains were made at the expense of Labour and the LibDems. But, let’s take a step back and ask the question: why did it get to the stage where Morris thinks Johnson is indefensible? Because I, like many others, saw how it unfolded. The SNP kept repeating, “Johnson is bad for Scotland” and what did Davidson, Carlaw, Ross and Morris — all Remainers — do? F all. So, now we’re in the situation where the people who didn’t defend their leader now want to hide him. That’s self-serving BS. If they had defended him then, they wouldn’t feel the need to hide him now. It seems simple to me: Douglas Ross is asking for our trust. But how can we trust him, if he doesn’t trust his own leader? It is a myth that the “red wall” revolution which occurred in England could have been replicated north of the border. That breakthrough was already made by Ruth Davidson, years before. What? Ruth Davidson is, in large part, responsible for where we are now. By foolishly siding with the SNP over Brexit, she depressed the natural Scottish Leave vote, leading to years of SNP soundbites claiming \"Scotland didn\u0027t vote for Brexit\". Didn’t ANYONE on her team advise her that SIDING WITH THE SNP was a bad idea? Weren’t you on that team, Adam? In the years since the referendum, Davidson barely acknowledged the one million Scottish Leavers. She fought Boris Johnson and Brexit all the way, until she was practically forced to resign. It’s also a myth to say that she was responsible for the increase in Tory votes in 2016. The main driver of that surge was the non-Tories who switched sides temporarily because they were so sick of Sturgeon banging on about independence so soon after the referendum. Since then, Scottish Tories have been losing votes. Meanwhile, Boris delivered Brexit and — all together now — got an 80-seat majority.\u0026nbsp; Even now, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg are doing a better job of defending the UK than the Scottish Conservatives. Because they have both the platform and a simple, positive, message. In fact, one fascinating piece of internal analysis revealed that more than half the voters of a heavily working-class Ayrshire ward voted Conservative in 2019. That was not where the problem lay. Morris admits growth is coming from working-class voters, so shouldn’t the Party be concentrating on getting some more of them? Why is he so focussed on the middle class? The argument also neglects the fact that the kind of people in the north of England who voted Conservative for the first time last year would likely be dyed-in-the-wool SNP supporters if they lived a couple of hundred miles to the north. They might not like the comparison, but there’s barely a cigarette paper between a working-class SNP voter in Lanarkshire and their Brexity Burnley counterpart. What evidence-free nonsense is this? These working-class voters all voted for Brexit. The SNP is anti-Brexit. And in the sentence above he said that they voted Conservative in Ayrshire. The Scottish Conservatives certainly didn’t drop from 13 MPs to six last December because they did not embrace Boris enough – quite the opposite. Why does Morris feel he has to lie here? The Scottish Conservative Party has never embraced Boris or Brexit.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; For many middle-class Scots, Brexit was the primary issue, and they would rather lend their vote to the passionately pro-EU Nicola Sturgeon, even if it meant they would have to say no to her next time she asks a bigger question. This is utter nonsense. In the last General Election, the Conservative vote in Scotland stayed the same. Labour votes transferred to the SNP. And why the constant focus on \"middle-class Scots\"? That, too, explained the SNP’s election strategy. One, talk about independence to rally the troops, generate donations and persuade activists to go out door-knocking and leafleting in the dead of winter. Two, in the final two weeks, when the country wakes up to the fact there’s an election on, slam the brakes on separation chat and climb aboard a tour bus which reads “Stop Brexit” alongside a huge photo of the First Minister as if she were promoting a £5 Megabus deal from Glasgow to Brussels.It was an inspired strategy, and the reward was another stunning election victory. Sturgeon’s pitch wasn’t particularly inspired. It was a craven ploy to get votes from disaffected Remainers, despite her being quite willing to leave Europe in the event of a positive referendum result. Yet, despite this, the Scottish Conservatives didn’t think, “Hang on, by doing the opposite of Sturgeon, we can pick up all those who are for Brexit!” The actual problem was, and still is, middle-class Remainers in the Scottish Conservative Party who can’t deliver a positive message for Brexit. This is what Douglas Ross had to say, just four weeks ago: \"There is no getting away from the fact that Brexit, and how it has been delivered, has undermined the perception that there are common shared values that unite us.\" To be clear, he said: Brexit has undermined our shared values. That sounds a lot like something Sturgeon would say. These comments, combined with other unnecessary and foolish statements he made on the same day,\u0026nbsp; praising Nicola Sturgeon’s communication skills, agreeing with SNP immigration policies and their ideas on House of Lords reform, and the ridiculous pantomime where he played Good Cop, Bad Cop over furlough funds, caused a wave of anger and disappointment among Scots Tories. Many said they had had enough of the party and more than a few cut up their membership cards. How do the Conservatives win some of those people back? Just a thought, but maybe start by listening to them?\u0026nbsp; It’s important that they do if they want to stop an SNP majority next year.\u0026nbsp; Amazing insight. Such a win would lead to a First Minister marching to Westminster with a fresh mandate for a second Scottish independence referendum, a mandate the UK Government would not be able to reject. This is utterly false. Boris Johnson fought multiple legal and parliamentary challenges, delivered Brexit and — here we go again — got an 80-seat majority on a manifesto pledge to preserve the Union. Do you really think he’s going to be the PM who allows a minority of Separatists to break up the UK?\u0026nbsp; And if you don’t believe me, here’s Wings (None So blind Sept 30, 2020) : \"Johnson absolutely DOES have both the moral and political right to refuse. He has the political right because Westminster – as Nicola Sturgeon never tires of reminding us by refusing to countenance an “illegal” vote – is sovereign over Holyrood, and he controls Westminster. And he has the moral right because he stood for election just nine months ago on an unambiguous manifesto pledge of refusal, and he won a clear majority in the UK parliament on that manifesto.\" Yet, here is Morris, advocating that the person who delivered that electoral success through an unambiguous message to “Get Brexit Done”, should somehow not be allowed to bring that same winning message to Scotland. And, by default, he’s saying that those who think Brexit is a bad idea should be unopposed, and, it seems, be advised to agree with the Nationalists. Appeasement is not a winning strategy. In a choice between people with conviction and those trying to copy them, people will choose those with conviction every time.\u0026nbsp; The people they need at the ballot box are the middle-class pro-Union voters, and whether or not they return to the fold probably depends on how leaving the EU plays out in the next few months. Is that what your focus group told you? FFS. The Covid-19 pandemic will probably muddy those waters, which means the less said about European constitutional affairs in that period, the better.\u0026nbsp; Run away, run away!\u0026nbsp; Morris’s whole article is like that scene in Monty Python and The Holy Grail, where the knights keep running away from a terrible predator, revealed as a fluffy rabbit? To paraphrase one of the knights: “Perhaps if we run away faster, it’ll confuse Sturgeon more?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnOdAT6H94s Losing Ms Ballantyne – who was the most right-wing of the 31 Tory MSPs – will help that drive.\u0026nbsp; Ballantyne is pro-Brexit, pro-Union and vocally anti-Nationalist. All of which are mainstream Conservative positions. She and Oliver Mundell also showed some backbone in voting against the SNP’s damaging lockdown restrictions, while almost every other Tory MSP voted with the SNP. Tell me how voting with the SNP is a Conservative position?\u0026nbsp; Ross’s job isn’t to agree. It is to fight them. ALL THE WAY. Ballantyne isn’t out of step with the Scottish Party. The Scottish Party is out of step with her, and with UK conservatism. We will shortly see more moderate voices put forward, not least near-daily appearances from Douglas Ross MP. And that is good news – he is highly competent, holds the line brilliantly, and won’t make gaffes. LOL. Scottish Tories had high hopes for Ross, but he has already alienated his base with his unforced errors. Every time I think that I could publish something positive about him (and we have in the past), he ruins it with an unforced error. Perhaps it’s his LibDem tendencies, or he’s being poorly advised, or maybe he’s not all that smart. But, whatever the reason, his favourability amongst Scottish Tories is dropping like a stone. With an election coming up, it’s a leader’s job to energise their base, so that they will go out and convince their friends and families that we can finally beat the Nationalists. You can’t do that if you’re constantly turning half of them off.\u0026nbsp; His refereeing credentials (which political opponents envy despite pretending otherwise). Envy? Don\u0027t be ridiculous. This is laughable. help him break through to working-class and urban Scotland They don’t. Nobody likes the referee. while his farming background and teuchter accent buy him favour everywhere else. I thought calling someone a ‘teuchter’ was a hate crime these days. But, in any case, none of that matters. What matters is how he fights in the political arena. Do not expect to see too much of Ruth Davidson. She may be a big asset on the campaign trail, but there is the awkwardness of her campaigning for a production from which she is departing. Her acceptance of a place in the House of Lords is another completely avoidable shot to the foot. And now that Ms Ballantyne is off the stage completely, there is less danger of party sources and disaffected candidates mouthing off about bad strategies and botched campaigning. In splendid isolation, here behind my wall.\u0026nbsp; And what of Mr Johnson? Regrettably, he can’t be banned outright, because that would become a “thing” in itself. Yes, banning \u0026lt;checks notes\u0026gt; The Prime Minister of the UK might just be ‘a thing’. Two visits maximum, I would say. One at the start and one a couple of weeks out from polling day, probably to a secretive factory or perhaps some kind of early-morning fishery establishment (assuming Brexit goes well for that group). They cannot afford to see more of him than that. Very generous of you. If I was Boris, I would eject you from the party immediately, for disloyalty. And visit anywhere in the UK, wherever, whenever, I’d like. If the election is painted as a choice between Nicola and Boris, there’s only one person the public is going to choose.\u0026nbsp; This is infantile logic. Boris Johnson is the ultimate weapon against Nicola Sturgeon. He can get headlines every day. His comments on devolution caused days of welcome discussion for those of us who see Holyrood as a failure. (No doubt Morris was one of the people who got his panties in a bunch over his comments.) The battle Morris is actually suggesting — Sturgeon vs Ross —\u0026nbsp; is the losing one. Ross simply cannot match Sturgeon’s cult of personality and ‘rock star’ status. Only Boris Johnson has the majority, the presence and the authority to slam Sturgeon every time — and yet Morris wants him to hide? Instead, we will probably see the visits of more palatable Conservatives from England, such as the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak.\u0026nbsp; I’ve said it before: Sunak is not safe. Nationalists will just demonise him like they demonise everyone else.\u0026nbsp; It’s what they do. They demonise Conservatives. They demonise Labour. They demonise Brexit. They demonise the UK. They demonise Boris. They’ll demonise the next PM and will continue to demonise everything they are against. And they’ve been so successful at it, that they’ve got the Scottish Conservative Party agreeing with them! Appeasing Separatists doesn’t stop them. It encourages them. Trying to be like them doesn’t stop them. They’ll rightly call you a fake and take your voters. Voters who will happily move, because they will always choose the real thing over inauthenticity. What stops them is the word, \"No\". Try it. Ultimately, this has to be a campaign fought and run in Scotland, as the 2016 one was.\u0026nbsp; This is also false. The break up of the UK concerns all UK citizens, as it will diminish us all. As the Prime Minister of the UK, Boris Johnson has the authority to say “enough is enough” and put the Separatists back in their box. Douglas Ross simply doesn’t have the same authority. If Mr Johnson wants an election campaign to undermine and jeopardise, there are plenty of local government and mayoral elections in England at the same time. Aside from parroting an SNP talking point, this is unbelievable arrogance and disloyalty. The pro-Brexit, pro-Johnson vote – where it exists at all – will probably turn out for the Scottish Conservatives anyway, especially when they realise the extent to which the Union is at stake here. And there we have it. Another arrogant fool dismissing his party’s core vote and taking them for granted. That’s quite a position to take when 22 of 26 Conservative MPS are elected through list seats, and those list votes are definitely up for grabs. If the Scottish Tories don’t get their act together, their voters will either not turn out to vote, or they will go to other list parties, such as Alliance For Unity or the Abolish The Scottish Parliament Party. Voting for either of those parties is not only a statement against the SNP, but a rebuke to the Tories, Labour and LibDems who won’t do what is necessary to fight against Scottish Nationalism. Even if they do not, there are far greater numbers to be gained in middle Scotland among people who might feel betrayed by Brexit, but will be equally anxious about the prospect of the UK’s break-up. Those people are there for the taking.\u0026nbsp; “Might” is doing a huge amount of work in that sentence. Voters who might feel betrayed by Brexit are apparently more important and numerous than the voters who are actually concerned about the break up of the UK. A hapless Richard Leonard-led Labour party won’t be speaking to them, and – unless they live in a select few pockets – neither will the Liberal Democrats. The fact that the Liberal Democrats are not hoovering up all these imaginary pro-UK, disaffected Remainers might give you a hint that they don’t exist.\u0026nbsp; Abandoning your principles to chase an imaginary focus group with policies that alienate your core votes is a sure route to electoral disaster. It’s not as if you don’t have an example: ask Labour. At least Starmer is finally cottoning on that the UK’s pooling and shared resources are something worth fighting for.\u0026nbsp; Scratch that, it seems Starmer, also badly advised, is now offering more appeasement, in the vain hope that the crocodile eats him last. The fact that some hard-right members and candidates are fleeing the scene makes success – whatever that looks like in the bonkers world of Scottish politics – all the more likely for Douglas Ross. The word ‘hard right’ speaks volumes here. Brexit is not a ‘hard right’ policy. It was voted for by 17 million people. It is the policy of the UK Conservative Party. We get it, Adam. You’re a disaffected, middle-class Remainer who doesn’t like Boris, and you’ve bought into the SNP’s Bad Boris schtick. But the vast majority of Tories are not like you. If you want to be a LibDem, go for it. I’m sure they’ll be happy to have more members. But stop pretending that you are a Conservative, while actively subverting the party’s leader and flagship policy. Most Scottish Tories see Boris and his team as the ones who delivered Brexit and are working for UK interests right now. They see Boris questioning Devolution, they see Gove strategising on how to strengthen the UK, and they see Rees-Mogg and others sticking it to the Nationalists every day.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/Jacob_Rees_Mogg/status/1333780480294981632 But when they look at the Scottish Tories, they see appeasement, disloyalty and loserthink. They see a last-stand-of-the-Tory-Remainers enclave that is subverting the UK party, ignoring one million Scottish Leave voters, and, in trying to distance themselves from the UK party, actually furthering the aims of Nationalists. They see yesterday’s men with yesterday’s plans. We’ll know who’s right in a few months. It’s likely that the opposition will ignore their base and not work together to create an electoral pact. And, despite representing the majority of voters, they will once again hand victory to the SNP.\u0026nbsp; Given Ross’s performance to date, it’s highly likely a huge chunk of Scottish Tories will either stay at home or go to other list parties, and the Tories will lose many list MPs.\u0026nbsp; We will expect to see Mr Ross’s resignation the morning after the election. Maybe then the Scottish Conservatives can get back to the business of supporting their base, supporting UK policies and fighting, rather than agreeing with, the SNP.\u0026nbsp; Or maybe Boris should just close the Scottish Party altogether. With ‘friends’ like them, he doesn’t need enemies.

Extracts of his major revelations follow... Read the full statement here After a preamble about his background as an ex-ambassador, diplomat and author, Murray says: \u00279. I discovered with a high degree of certainty that the leaker was Liz Lloyd, Chief of Staff to Nicola Sturgeon.\u0027 \u002712. Alex Salmond, with whom I had only very slight prior acquaintance, invited me to meet him in the George Hotel in Edinburgh. Here, for the first time, he told me that Nicola Sturgeon had been behind the process designed to generate false accusations against him. He said as well as Mackinnon and Evans, Liz Lloyd was responsible for the actual orchestration.\u0027 \u002714. Mr Salmond further told me that there was a massive police operation underway to try to get accusers to come forward against him…He understood that over 400 people had been interviewed by the police... stated that she had been called in and interviewed by the police because many years ago Alex Salmond had been said by another person to have been seen kissing her on the cheeks in a theatre foyer. The woman stated she had told them it was a perfectly normal greeting...A \u0027retired officer challenged the interviewer as to how he could be involved in such a corrupt stitch up….all the accusations emanated from the same small coterie, there was not a single accusation from an outside or independent source.\u0027 \u002716. I had never in forty years heard a hint of gossip surrounding Alex Salmond and sexual behaviour, with the single exception of a rumoured romantic attachment with . But that had not involved any rumour of unwanted advances by Mr Salmond, quite the opposite ; it was rather widely believed in nationalist circles that she had set her cap at him. The common joke was that was a booby prize.\u0027 The section above was originally published by Murray with the names of the persons involved. He has since redacted it. We have no knowledge of whether those people were witnesses or defendents or were involved in the trial or not. 17. \u0027It had been impossible to follow the judicial review case without concluding that a very unfair process had been undertaken against Alex Salmond, and that it was impossible this could have happened without the knowledge and approval of Nicola Sturgeon.\u0027 \u002718. I asked what the motive could be…he had retired from the party leadership before, and then come back, and perhaps Nicola had concluded he needed a stake through the heart.\u0027He had made plain to her that he was not happy with her lack of progress towards an Independence referendum following the Brexit vote. \u002719. Alex Salmond was plainly very unhappy. He said that he believed that Nicola was banking on his loyalty to the SNP and to the Independence movement, thinking that he would not split the party by revealing what or who was behind the allegations against him.\u0027\u0026nbsp; \u002723. Alex…blamed himself for having established far too centralised a system of power in Scottish Government and the SNP, and not taking account of how far that was open to abuse by a person of ill-will.\u0027 \u002724. In June 2019 I met with a person well known in the Independence movement who informed me that they had been present at a meeting with Nicola Sturgeon and key members of her inner circle, including ministers, which had gamed the possible outcome of the Salmond affair...The view of the meeting was that if Alex Salmond could be convicted on just a single count, he would be destroyed politically forever…He would be on the register of sex offenders and branded a rapist in the public mind, even if the actual offence convicted was knee touching.\u0027\u002726. What struck me, both at the time and still, was that it was impossible to understand the account as given without it involving of necessity corrupt collusion between Nicola Sturgeon’s ministers and aides and the Crown Office over the handling of the Salmond case and the charges being brought. \u002731. In March 2020 I had explained and briefly shown to me by a source with good access the content of evidence related to the Salmond trial, much of which was to be excluded from the trial itself by the judge as collateral.\u0027\u002732. This material included the message from Peter Murrell, Chief Executive Officer of the SNP, to Sue Ruddick, Chief Operating Officer, to the effect that it was now the right time to put pressure on Police Scotland to move forward against Alex Salmond.\u0027 \u0027It included the message from Ms Ruddick (I do not recall the recipient) to the effect that the problem was with Police Scotland refusing to detail precisely what evidence they required. If they would specify, then she could get that evidence for them.\u0027 \u0027It included the message from Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, after the Scottish Government had abandoned its judicial review case, to the effect that they had lost a battle but won the war.\u0027\u002733. It included the message from to another complainer to the effect that she had a plan that would enable them to have a strongly detrimental effect on Alex Salmond but have anonymity.\u0027 \u0027It included the message from t to the effect that she did not want to attend any further meetings regarding a possible complaint if redacted were going to be present as made her feel pressured rather than supported.\u0027 \u0027It included the message from Ian McCann to the effect that he would sit on redacted’s complaint until it became necessary to deploy it.\u0027 \u0027It included a number of messages from which gave the impression she was playing a central role in orchestrating and organising complainers, but I do not recall any specific details of those particular individual messages.\u0027 \u002739. In November 2019, I was told by a senior contact within the SNP…that a deal had been struck between Peter Murrell, and whereby would make an allegation of attempted rape against Alex Salmond, and Murrell would return to front line politics .\u0027 \u002740. If the public knew the identities of those being put up to make allegations, and just how close to Nicola Sturgeon they were, they would immediately understand what was happening\u0027 \u002741. That accusers included: Nicola Sturgeon. First Minister of Scotland Leader of the SNP\u0026nbsp;;Ian Blackford, UK Parliamentary Leader for the SNP\u0026nbsp;;Angus Robertson, Former UK Parliamentary Leader of the SNP\u0026nbsp;; \u0027The combination of the anonymity of these accusers, and the exclusion from the trial on the grounds of «\u0026nbsp;collateral evidence\u0026nbsp;» – and continued intention of the Crown Office to suppress – of the messages implicating Peter Murrell and Sue Ruddick in the conspiracy, has resulted in the denial to the Scottish public of information which there is the strongest possible public interest in knowing, in order for them to judge the actions of those in power over them.\u0027 \u002746. I was also in a deep dilemma as to what to do about it ; the same dilemma Alex Salmond was, and is, in. To expose that it was Nicola Sturgeon who masterminded the conspiracy against him would be a real blow to the Independence movement. \u0027But to watch a plot to imprison an innocent man potentially for the rest of his life unfold before my eyes was also horrifying.\u0027 After details of the trial and Murray\u0027s contempt of court charge: \u0027100.

In it, he says that his legal team has identified 46 documents out of nearly 400 that were released by The Scottish Government that neither he, nor his legal team, had previously seen. He says that many of these would have been ‘crucial’ to both the Judicial Review and his criminal trial. Salmond says the documents, which the Scottish Government not only have a duty to disclose, but also failed to disclose, despite a search warrant, would have reinforced the Judicial Review’s review of bias, not just of the Investigating Officer, Judith Mackinnon, but of the Permanent Secretary, Linda Evans. Salmond also says that these new documents may have allowed him to establish the relevance of the proceedings of the Judicial Review to his criminal case. However, they were judged to be excluded from the criminal case as irrelevant. He claims that the withholding of these documents amounts to contempt of court or perversion of justice by the Permanent Secretary. Salmond details three revelations in the withheld material: The Permanent Secretary met with the complainersThe Investigating Officer relayed his legal advice to complainers and witnessesMaterial about whether the matter was referred to the police against the wishes of the complainers The Permanent Secretary met with the complainers In the Judicial Review, Salmond says the new documents suggest that both the Permanent Secretary and the Investigating Officer met the complainers before he was informed of the complaint. This is despite Evans saying in evidence before the Committee that it would have been ‘inappropriate‘ for her to know the identities of the complainers before the complaints procedure was approved.\u0026nbsp; He notes that in the Judicial Review the person who is subject to the complaint does not get to offer their own defence. Instead, the Investigating Officer gathers evidence and facts that the Permanent Secretary uses to make their decision. He says impartiality of both the Investigating Officer and the Permanent Secretary should be paramount. He says, \"The Permanent Secretary knew of this meeting (and the associated notes) and chose not to disclose it, until now, which I find staggering…If this material had been disclosed, then the apparent bias of the Permanent Secretary as decision maker would have been introduced in our pleadings at the Judicial Review as an additional ground of review.\" He then says that not providing the relevant documents in the criminal case, in the face of a search warrant, is ‘a prima facie, a contempt of court’ and may be argued as an attempt to pervert the course of justice. The Investigating Officer relayed his legal advice to complainers and witnesses Salmond says that the Investigating Officer’s role as an impartial collector of the facts was not compatible with regular contact with the complainers, noting that the Investigating Officer described her view of his legal position -- which he supplied to the Permanent Secretary and was subject to legal professional privilege -- to the complainers and to witnesses. He says the issue is not that the Government was not allowed to meet the complainers, but the Investigating Officer should not have done so, and should not have shared his legal advice. He claims the documents show that the Investigating Officer speculated with one of the complainers on his legal ‘thinking’ and that the Officer also shared that advice with witnesses. Salmond says, \"these are not the actions of an impartial Investigating Officer\". He notes the irony of civil servants freely dispensing his privileged legal advice, while the Government they serve refuses to release its own legal advice. Material about whether the matter was referred to the police against the wishes of the complainers The Permanent Secretary told the Committee that the interests of the complainers were always at the forefront of her consideration and the view of civil servants when embarking on the investigation was that any police referral had to respect the wishes of the complainers. However, in August 2018, it appears that the Permanent Secretary ignored the view of the complainers when referring to the police, instead claiming it was referred to ‘on legal advice’. Salmond says that \"the degree of persuasion applied to the complainers would have been highly relevant to the criminal case\". Finally, Salmond talks about articles that remain undisclosed.\u0026nbsp; \"Despite the general admonition from Lord Pentland in the civil case, on the general requirement of disclosure by the Scottish Government, a Commission and Diligence in December 2018, a search warrant in the criminal case, and the repeated calls for documents made by this Committee, it is still far from clear that all relevant documents have been provided. My legal team, the Committee and indeed the Crown Office have all experienced similar frustration, obstruction and delays in securing documentation\". He says the lack of disclosure led to his win in the Judicial Review, and the awarding of £500,000 of taxpayers’ money in costs. For the criminal case he says, \"the blatant disregard of the provisions of a search warrant secured by the Crown would appear to be a prima facie contempt of court\" and he is pursuing the matter with the Lord Advocate.

The campaign draws on the Marquis de Sade’s principle that psychological satisfaction comes only through enduring and inflicting sustained bouts of carefully controlled agony. “That\u0027s why we stand in vats of cold porridge on a wet weekend,” he insisted. “Trust me, we’re the only intellectually honest campaign out there.” Prof. Crispin Quint of the Political Sexology Project has been researching the often underestimated connections between pain and politics. “From a Sado-masochist perspective, the struggle for independence is such a profoundly thrilling prospect,” he notes. “The cuts will be excruciating, or so they hope.” Master Frank agrees. “I know a lot of mainstream Indy supporters shrug their shoulders, arguing ‘no pain, no gain’,” he explained. “But they miss the point. Pain is patriotic – PAIN IS GAIN!” Joining the group’s volunteers, Maddy Clark (22), cut a distinctive figure in her self-designed tartan latex as she handed out leaflets on Leith Walk. The young dental hygienist was particularly enthusiastic about the abuse she was receiving, even among the politically jaded. “I’ve already been cat-called by a couple of workmen, and it’s only just breakfast-time.”\u0026nbsp; S\u0026amp;M for Scotland believes that a referendum victory will bring S\u0026amp;M culture into the mainstream. “We won’t need to go to special clubs (or even the dentist) to get our kicks. After Indy, we’ll be able to enjoy the agony in our everyday lives. We can even save money – these whips and lashes are not cheap, believe me. Scexit actually makes economic sense for your ordinary, hardworking sadomasochist.” Claims of a golden age after independence only intensify the case. “Bring it on!” Master Frank exclaimed to reporters. “It just lulls people into a sense of complacency, so when the pain actually comes, it’ll be all the more excruciating!”\u0026nbsp; A desire for the smack of firm government is another key factor, Professor Quint believes. “In fact, like most liberation movements, the SNP will be in charge of a de-facto one-party state after Indy. Even now, they’re great centralisers. It’s the next best thing to a full-on dictatorship.” Meanwhile, as Maddy and her colleagues lobbied evening shoppers at Tescos, she had no doubts the constitutional constipation will all be worth it. “After all – every little hurts.”","date":"2021-03-21","summary":"The Sunday Mail, 17 Apr. 2022 Indy supporters were whipped into a frenzy yesterday as S\u0026amp;M for Scotland officially launched under the eye-catching ..."},{"title":"Scotland\u0027s devolution disaster","url":"/articles/scotlands-devolution-disaster/","content":"It’s been 25 years since the devolution experiment was inflicted on Scotland, and the result is an unspeakable disaster. It’s a disaster because The Scottish Parliament, which was set up to stop Scottish Nationalism, is now being abused by the SNP to promote a separatist agenda, while Scotland’s services decline daily and scandal mounts up. And it is ‘unspeakable’ because few want to discuss whether the source problem is devolution itself, even its natural opponents. When, a few days ago, Lord Frost published an article (The SNP’s implosion is a chance to put failing devolution into reverse) that said... In particular, Scotland does not need to be an independent actor on the world stage; it should not be able to legislate to disrupt free trade within the UK; and it does not need to have most tax-raising powers currently available to it. These powers are embryonic, independent government powers. They aren’t necessary to run an effective local administration, which is what devolution should be about. Just like when Boris Johnson dared to say that ‘Devolution is a disaster’, The Scottish Tory establishment was aghast, with list-MSP Murdo Fraser calling the comments “nonsense”, adding: “Devolution has allowed us to shine a light on SNP failures. The Conservatives will not be rolling it back.” A very dim light indeed. But, it could, and should, be argued that Scots would not need to ‘shine a light’ on SNP tax, free trade, or foreign embassies, if they did not have the platform to make these decisions. Or even to go as far as saying that the abolition of the Parliament would halt the SNP’s separatist pretensions. But why wouldn’t the Tories want to roll it back? What advantage has it given them? The reality is that none of the major parties wants The Scottish Parliament. Mealy-mouthed Scottish Tory MSPs aside, grassroots Tories never wanted it. They voted against its establishment because they knew, and were proved right, that it was a way for nationalists to promote separation. Labour doesn’t want it. Despite being set up to secure Labour rule in Scotland, it has had the opposite effect. It allowed the SNP to falsely claim they were socialists and usurp their position. Labour would rather power be further devolved to local authorities. And the SNP don’t even want it. They want ‘independence’. They can never make devolution a success because, if it was, it would undermine their case for a separate state. And then there\u0027s the cost, both real and opportunity. So the unspeakable truth is that no-one actually wants The Scottish Parliament, but the Scottish political establishment will not say so. It will use all kinds of fabrications and misdirections to try to tell ordinary people that the failed system they see all around them is actually deserving of their love. It isn’t. When any system fails its purpose, it must be reassessed. This series aims to prompt a discussion into the reality of devolution: Why does it exist? Why does it have the powers it currently has? What have Scots gained and what have they lost? What do they stand to gain or lose in future if the current system continues? Is the Scottish Government giving Scots good value? How do we judge that value? What could the money, time and effort be better spent on? Can the Scottish Government be reformed? Should it be abolished? If so, what would replace it? There are no simple answers to these questions. Anyone who thinks there are is encouraged to enter the debate to discover its nuances. Perhaps, some readers will think these questions shouldn\u0027t be asked at all. But we have to start somewhere. The focus of these articles is primarily on devolution as it affects Scotland. We are not experts in Welsh or Northern Irish devolution, and they are mentioned primarily for context. However, it is important to note that devolution across the UK, not only affects Scots, Welsh and people from Northern Ireland, but affects everyone in the UK, because the potential breakup of our country and the good governance of its constituent parts affects us all. How things worked before devolution Before the advent of legislative devolution in the late 1990s, the local matters of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were managed by a series of different Government Cabinet positions: In Scotland during the period 1707 to 1999 After the Union with England Act, the Parliament of Scotland was abolished on 25th March 1707, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain was created on 1st May 1707, represented by a single Parliament of Great Britain located at Westminster in London. The post of Secretary of State for Scotland was set up until the Jacobite rising of 1745, after which, responsibility for Scotland lay primarily with the office of the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, usually exercised by the Lord Advocate. The Secretaries of State were reorganised in 1782 and the duties then came under the Secretary of State for the Home Department. From 1885 to 1999 - Administrative devolution 1885 saw the creation of the Scottish Office and the post of Secretary for Scotland and from 1892 the Secretary for Scotland sat in the cabinet, but the position was not officially recognised as a full member of the cabinet of the United Kingdom, until the Secretary for Scotland post was upgraded to full Secretary of State rank as Secretary of State for Scotland in 1926. The Scottish Office was a department of\u0026nbsp; the United Kingdom Government from 1885 until the advent of legislative devolution in 1999, and exercised a wide range of government functions in relation to Scotland under the management of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Following the establishment of legislative devolution in 1999, most of its functions were transferred to the newly-established Scottish Executive (the Scottish ‘Government’), with a small residue of functions retained by the Scotland Office. Since 1999 - Legislative Devolution After the 1999 Scottish devolution, the powers of the Scottish Office were divided, with most transferred to the Scottish Government or to other British government departments, leaving only a limited role for the Scotland Office. In Wales, the secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office (created in 1964) was responsible for many functions regarding the governance of Wales, until the advent of legislative devolution when the Wales office replaced the Welsh Office, still headed by the Secretary of State for Wales. Before legislative devolution (from 1972-1998) in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for NI handled the functions of the governance of that part of the UK. After 1998, most of these functions were hived off to the control of the Stormont devolved executive and the role of the Secretary of State for NI has been severely reduced. Before the introduction of legislative devolution in the late 1990s, the Houses of Parliament at Westminster were the primary source of all legislation within the UK. Acts of the UK Parliament were the main method by which Parliament created binding law, and the process by which a legislative proposal became law followed a rigorous system of checks and balances. An Act of Parliament may also allow a government minister or other public authority to legislate further via secondary (subordinate or delegated) legislation. After legislative devolution, the newly created devolved legislatures (Holyrood, the Welsh ‘parliament’ and Stormont) were given the task of passing legislation on devolved matters and some areas (reserved matters) were retained for Westminster’s consideration only. A brief history of devolution There had been calls for setting up a Scottish parliament since the 1930s, but the idea was very unpopular with the Scottish public and never built up any significant head of steam, until the 1970s, when the Labour Party adopted the cause after becoming concerned with the apparent rise in popularity of the Scottish National Party, which had began to pick up some seats in Parliament. Consequently, the Scotland Act 1978 was passed, which was intended to establish a Scottish Assembly as a devolved legislature for Scotland.\u0026nbsp; At a referendum held in the following year, the Act failed to gain the necessary 40% level of approval required by an amendment, and was never put into effect. The idea of a Scottish parliament then fell to the wayside during the 1980s. (A referendum on establishing a Welsh assembly returned an overwhelming 79.74% against to 20.26% in favour and so the idea was not implemented in Wales). After the referendum, The Campaign for a Scottish Assembly (CSA) was launched at a rally in Edinburgh on 1st March 1980, and led by Jack Brand (later headed by Jim Boyack). Four months later, in July, the Labour Party set up a campaign for a Scottish assembly. The CSA came to adopt the stance that the cause of a Scottish parliament would be best advanced\u0026nbsp; by a convention with more democratic legitimacy, and set up a committee, chaired by Professor Sir Robert Grieve. This committee published the Claim of Right for Scotland, which employed several constitutionally spurious arguments, based on a misrepresentation of the 1698 Scottish Claim of Right. The role of the CSA was then superseded by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, established in 1989, after prominent Scottish individuals signed the Claim of Right, headed by Canon Kenyon Wright. David Steel and Harry Ewing were co-chairmen. Various organisations participated in the Convention, such as the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Green Party, the Communist Party, the Scottish Trades Union Congress. Initially, the Scottish National Party participated, but then withdrew, owing to the convention\u0027s unwillingness to discuss Scottish independence as a constitutional option. The Convention then published its blueprint for devolution, ‘Scotland\u0027s Parliament, Scotland\u0027s Right’, on 30th November 1995. This provided the basis for the structure of the Scottish Parliament, established in 1999. The Labour Party adopted the idea of a Scottish Parliament, Welsh and NI assemblies in the early 1990s, under the leadership of John Smith, once again in the extremely questionable belief that it was necessary due to a small upturn in the popularity of the SNP. On 11th September 1997, The Scottish devolution referendum was held, giving voters two questions: should there be a Scottish Parliament and should it have tax-varying powers. The result was a majority in favour of both proposals, and the Parliament was established following an election in 1999.\u0026nbsp; The referendum asked the following questions: Do you agree that there should be a Scottish Parliament as proposed by the Government? and Do you agree that a Scottish Parliament should have tax-raising powers as proposed by the Government? It returned the following results: To the first question: Yes: 1,775,045 (74.29%) No: 614,400 (25.71%) Valid votes: 2,389,445 (99.92%) Total votes: 2,391,268 (100.00%) Registered voters/turnout: 3,973,673 (60.18%) To the second question: Yes: 1,512,889 (63.48%) No: 870,263 (36.52%) Valid votes: 2,383,152 (99.66%) Invalid or blank votes: 19,013 (0.80%) Total votes: 2,391,268 (100.00%) Registered voters/turnout:3,973,673 (60.18%) Similar polls in Wales and NI established devolved assemblies in these two parts of the UK. In the case of Wales, the proposition passed by only 0.6%: 50.30% for, 49.70% against. Warnings unheeded The proponents of legislative devolution vehemently insisted that it posed ‘no threat whatsoever’ to the integrity of the UK, as there was absolutely no way that it could be used to break up the UK.\u0026nbsp; The Labour politician Tam Dalyell was sceptical: during the debates on devolution in the House of Commons in the mid–late 1970s, he became synonymous with a forceful opposition to the devolution of power from Westminster to the constituent parts of the UK. Dalyell correctly foresaw that the creation of devolved legislatures in these parts of the UK would achieve nothing of any real value and simply significantly fuel the separatist nationalist cause, which, he predicted, would inevitably lead to the complete dissolution of the United Kingdom. He also foresaw that such constitutional arrangements were intrinsically flawed and would lead to a constitutional crisis as Westminster and the devolved legislatures clashed over who had authority over what, and to what degree. Most famously, he illustrated an example of this with his ‘West Lothian Question’, which highlighted that more than one legislature in any single (unitary) country (the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in this case) would only cause administrative confusion. He summed up devolution as being: A one-way motorway to independence with no turn-offs or roundabouts. Dalyell has been vindicated on all the above views by the events of the last twenty-plus years of legislative devolution. Throughout these years, the citizens of the UK have had the constitutional fiction that devolution would strengthen the UK fed to them by pro-legislative devolution politicians and the media. Devolutionists insisted time and time again that their plans would be the ‘thing that saved the United Kingdom from nationalism and from being broken up’. Indeed, Labour politician George Robertson even claimed, in 1995, that it would ‘kill off nationalism forever’ — something that must be near the top of the list of statements that have later proved to be completely wrong (perhaps only beaten by Neville Chamberlain’s ‘peace in our time’ statement in 1938). It’s been claimed, over and over again, that legislative devolution is just ‘autonomy within the UK’ and that its powers are limited. The devolved administrations were simply supposed to deal with local matters only, with national issues strictly reserved for the UK Parliament at Westminster. Take the Constitution of the UK, for example. It’s a reserved matter, but the SNP (as well as Plaid Cymru and the Irish nationalists) simply ignore this and keep pushing for independence/re-unification referendums, despite the supposed constitutional bar on them getting involved in such matters, and despite the judgement of the UK’s Supreme Court, which has ruled that the devolved administrations have no right to run referendums on the constitution.\u0026nbsp; Yet, nationalists persist, with increasingly bizarre and unconstitutional schemes, such as ‘de facto’ referendums (using a General or Scottish Government election as a proxy referendum) or even claiming that independence can be claimed unilaterally. As Dayell predicted, devolution has enabled Scottish, Welsh and Irish nationalism to rise to political dominance (or given them much more prominence in the case of Wales), displacing UK-wide parties and allowed those nationalisms to use the devolved legislatures as a platform to advance their independence/reunification agendas.\u0026nbsp; The SNP’s antics have emboldened nationalists in other parts of the UK. Plaid have recently publicly stated that they will ask for an independence referendum if Scotland asks for a second one, and Irish nationalists have made one public call after another for reunification. A federal UK does not solve this problem: It’s easy to imagine each region fighting to leave the UK, aided and abetted by other regions, against the centre. Continuous and unnecessary appeasement This continuous capitulation to nationalist narratives culminated in Alex Salmond managing to push the inept David Cameron into holding a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014. Cameron surrendered to the SNP in 2012, despite only 28% of Scots supporting the issue at that time.\u0026nbsp; As the vote grew closer, some in the pro-UK side panicked, leading to the ‘The Vow’, a joint statement from the leaders of the three main pro-UK parties, being published in The Daily Record, one of the main tabloid newspapers in Scotland, that also backed a ‘No’ vote in the referendum. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg promised more powers for Scotland in the event of a ‘No’ vote in the Scottish independence referendum of 2014: The Scottish parliament would be permanent Extensive new devolved powers would be delivered The Barnett formula for funding Scottish Government expenditure would continue Ultimately, the nationalists lost the September 2014 referendum, gaining only 45% of the vote. Later analysis by Lord Ashcroft showed the Vow to have made little difference to the final result, yet it had been promised. Cameron’s belief that a referendum loss for the SNP would put the issue to bed, was also sorely mistaken. Nationalists had just increased their vote share to 45% and they would spend the following years desperately trying to increase that. They now had the myth of inevitability on their side and inconvenient pre-referendum assertions that it would be ‘once in a generation’ were swept aside. Meanwhile, the UK Government did nothing to rein this in, acting out of fear that any action they took, despite a majority of Scots supporting it, would be seen to be provoking nationalists and increase their support. In effect, Nationalists acted as though they had won the referendum, while the UK Government acted as though it had lost. To fulfil the promises of The Vow, The Smith Commission was set up on 18th September 2014. The Commission’s recommendations were the result of cross-party talks by Holyrood’s five political parties, the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and the Scottish National Party, as well as submissions from the public and organisations. Approximately 14,000 emails and letters were received from the public, with another 250 contributions from groups. The SNP called for full control over fiscal and tax policy to be devolved from Westminster. They also called for powers over welfare and broadcasting in their submission to the body looking into strengthening Holyrood. Other SNP proposals included calls for a wide range of other powers to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood, including control over income tax, national insurance, corporation tax, capital gains tax, fuel duty, air passenger duty and inheritance tax. They also demanded that welfare and employment policy must be devolved, as well as other areas like energy and broadcasting. The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats, who had all supported a ‘no’ vote in the referendum, each submitted proposals which were similar to the findings of commissions they had each held before the referendum. The Labour Party said it wanted powers which would allow the Scottish government to raise 40% of its own budget and increase the top rate of tax, as well as control over housing benefit and attendance allowance, but said other areas, like VAT, should remain with Westminster. The Conservatives said Holyrood must be responsible for setting the rates and bands of personal income tax as well as a share of VAT. The Liberal Democrats said Scotland must raise most of the money it spends, but issues like welfare and defence should remain with the UK government. The pro-independence Greens called for the Scottish Parliament to be given wide economic powers, including borrowing and taxation, control over most of the welfare system and further energy powers. The SNP and Scottish Greens, who had supported a ‘yes’ vote, also called for ‘devo max’ – full fiscal autonomy from Westminster. These recommendations would form the basis of draft legislation, eventually passed in March 2016. The commission published its recommendations on 27th November 2014, giving a host of new powers to the Parliament, without giving the public a chance to vote on the recommendations. They included: Complete power to set income tax rates and bands except for the Personal Allowance and administration (which is still carried out by HMRC.) The allocation of a proportion of the VAT collected in Scotland, amounting to the first ten percent of the standard rate (so with the current standard VAT rate of 20%, Scotland would receive 50% of the receipts). However, the Scottish Parliament would not have power to influence the UK\u0027s overall VAT rate and would not be a devolved tax. Increased borrowing powers to support capital investment and ensure budgetary stability. These powers are to be agreed with the UK government. UK legislation to state that the Holyrood and Scottish Government are permanent institutions. Powers to legislate over how Holyrood is elected and run. The power to extend the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, allowing them to vote in the 2016, and later, Scottish Parliament elections. Control over a number of benefits including disability payments, winter fuel payments and the housing elements of Universal Credit. Powers to make discretionary payments in any area of welfare. Control over Air Passenger Duty charged to passengers flying from airports within Scotland. Responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate\u0027s economic assets in Scotland, including the Crown Estate\u0027s seabed and mineral and fishing rights, and the net surplus revenue generated from these assets, to be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. Power to allow public sector operators to bid for rail franchises, funded and specified by Scottish ministers. The continuation of the Barnett formula. New rules to define how it will be adjusted at the point when powers are transferred and thereafter to be agreed by the Scottish and UK governments and put in place prior to the powers coming into force. These rules will ensure that neither the Scottish nor UK governments will lose or gain financially from the act of transferring a power. MPs representing constituencies across the whole of the UK would continue to decide the UK\u0027s budget, including income tax.\u0026nbsp; The Scottish and UK governments to draw up and agree on a memorandum of understanding to ensure that devolution is not detrimental to UK-wide critical national infrastructure in relation to matters such as defence and security, immigration, trade and energy. The commission considered devolving power to vary all elements of Universal Credit (rather than just its housing element) but this was not adopted as a recommendation. Reaction to the report’s findings was generally negative or muted. The SNP thought they didn’t go far enough, claiming that too little power would be devolved to Scotland. Former Labour First Minister Jack McConnell described Smith as a ‘shambles’ and called on Cameron to lead a new constitutional convention. Malcolm Rifkind, a former Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland, also expressed support for the idea of a new commission. Prime Minister David Cameron responded to these suggestions by promising to look into any new proposals at a later date, whilst pressing on with implementing the Commission’s recommendations first. The Smith Commision was an answer to a problem that didn’t exist. After their defeat, Nationalists should have been told that they lost and that the people of Scotland did not want further powers transferred to the devolved assembly. In Ruth Davidson’s words, the UK Government should have ‘put the boot in’. But instead, the UK Government gave separatists more powers to use and abuse, and those who wanted to break up the UK were given a clear signal that more agitation, more division, more grievance, would give them more powers, even if they were in a minority.\u0026nbsp;This resulted in eight years of further division and declining standards, as nationalists and their appeasers contined to use the Scottish Government to promote separation.

The third and final part will be published on Wednesday, May 3, and will ask \u0027where do we go from here?

They are known, not just for their world-leading skills, but for their authenticity. These working-class men have developed and promoted their talents to the top of their fields and have gained as much respect from the quality of their work as from their uncompromising attitude to their craft. No-one can say that their work, and attitude to it, is not authentic. These men are: the Emmy-winning actor Brian Cox, Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream, and Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting. I deeply respect each of these men as artists: Trainspotting is one of my favourite films: we quote it all the time in our house. Primal Scream’s ‘We wanna get loaded and we wanna have a good time’ was part of our 90s soundtrack, and it seems like Brian Cox seems to star in every second film we watch, as well as killing it in Succession (not secession). Yet, when it comes to politics, these men, and many as famous and not as famous as them, have allowed themselves to flirt with, and be seduced by, that most inauthentic of creeds; the cult of Nationalism. They claim to be socialists, but support, in various degrees, the crude us-and-them politics of that selfish ideology. How did they abandon their socialist principles? Perhaps Nationalism seemed a reasonable path to take at the time, considering the alternatives. But now, years in, and far from home, it seems they are lost. Cox is currently promoting his autobiography. Putting The Rabbit In The Hat as well as the third season of Succession, the critically-acclaimed, satirical TV show centered around Logan Roy, a Scots-born media mogul, played by Cox, and his wayward children; think Rupert Murdoch as King Lear. Cox fills Roy with the kind of world-weary growls, self-pity, aggression and bitterness that perhaps only a Scot could bring to the role, as he clings to the threads of his empire, while his children work to usurp him. Memes of Roy telling us all to ‘Fuck off’ are all across the internet.\u0026nbsp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzYxJV_rmE8 Talking to Mark Kermode in The Guardian, this past Sunday, it’s clear that Cox thinks deeply about the roles he plays. If only he thought so deeply about his politics. The actor used to be a socialist, providing voice overs for Labour party broadcasts, but he was dismayed, as many were, by Blair’s support for the Iraq War: “Oh boy,” he says, as if shouldering the weight of the world. “You know, I was a big Labour man for such a long time. Then the whole ‘weapons of mass destruction’ thing happened...The hubris of Blair just made me go: ‘Who does this man think he is?’ And I helped him, because I did ‘the Voice of Labour’. I was really excited. I thought: ‘This is the beginning of something.’ But we were never quite able to do it…” The thought trails off, and he looks at me with a weary shrug. He continues... “You know, as a kid I always thought: ‘Who am I? Who am I supposed to be? Where do I fit in? How do I do my job?’ I’d always been a bit… like that about Scottish nationalism. And I don’t like the word ‘nationalism’ – I hate that word.” Kermode immediately homes in: \"But Brian, the party you support is literally called the Scottish National party.\"“I know, I know,” he says, with a mixture of frustration and amusement.\u0026nbsp; Why does Cox claim to not like \u0027Nationalism\u0027, but actively supports that ugly ideology here in Scotland? Could it be that he knows that Nationalism is bad, but has somehow convinced himself that it suits his socialist principles?\u0026nbsp; Nature abhors a vacuum. As Scots turned away from Blair’s war, up popped Salmond and the SNP claiming they were the real progressives, the true anti-Tory vote, while cannily masking their core anti-English bigotry and selfishness (and the fact that they can never form a UK government). It worked: The SNP stole Labour’s votes by pretending to be socialists, and sent Scotland on the path of national division and grievance. Cox justifies his support by claiming that the SNP will magically give up power in an independent Scotland... “Because there’ll be other parties, and the paradigm will have to shift when we become an independent country.”\u0026nbsp; More on this below, but for now, it\u0027s a fallacy to think that the SNP will give up power after Separation: their voters don\u0027t want to, and their politicians want to keep that lovely gravy train going. Why wouldn’t they? If they achieve independence, after being voted in despite all their sleaze, corruption and mismanagement, does anyone really think they’d give it up so that someone more competent would be in charge? Not a chance. I explore this magical thinking in detail in Vote Indy, Get Tory. Cox goes on to say that Nicola Sturgeon has done an ‘astonishing’ job. Despite living in the United States, I think it’s fair of him to have an opinion on Scottish independence, but perhaps if he lived here in Scotland and saw our services spiralling the drain he’d have a different opinion on Scottish governance. What\u0027s astonishing is that Sturgeon has got away with ALL OF THE ABOVE. When people like Cox excuse a charismatic leader’s many failings for the good of the nation, then we are living in troubled political territory. The question is: why doesn’t he see it? On the same day, also in The Guardian, Irvine Welsh interviewed Bobby Gillepsie about Gillespie’s new memoir, Tenement Kid. Inevitably, the conversation turns to Scottish politics, and Welsh gives his view on why he wants to break up the UK... The media fanned the spark that had been there for years. Brexit became a kind of civil war of elites that everybody else was dragged into... I’m not as much for Scottish independence as I am against imperialist nation-states. I think it’s better to be governed by non-hierarchical nation-states that aren’t based on imperialist precepts and entrenched beliefs. I’m for Scottish independence as a mechanism for breaking up the UK, and I’m for English independence and Welsh independence. The real fear of elites in England is that, if Scotland is independent, at a stroke, there’s no royal family, no House of Lords, no Eton. And people in England are going to say – we’ll have some of that. Welsh builds his separatist dream on cherry-picked issues. To him, the UK is the House of Lords, Eton and The Royal Family, not the people of Liverpool, Harrogate and Brimingham. He wants to \u0027break up the UK\u0027 to destroy elites, while ignoring the common bonds between ordinary people, all of whom will be diminished, financially, culturally and socially, by the country’s break up.\u0026nbsp; I don’t think Welsh actually believes that England will say ‘we’ll have some of that\u0027 at all. Like all Nationalists he wants to make his part of the world better and leave everyone else to fend for themselves. Instead of doing the hard work to try to reform the House of Lords, he wants a short cut, so that his part of the country can get a better deal. In other words, like all Nationalists, he’s lazy and selfish. He also doesn’t seem to care that Scottish Nationalism has created an authoritarian, centralised, unanswerable and corrupt new Scottish Nationalist elite. But it’s oor elite! It’s oor one-party state! Gillespie, though, being the son of a Labour man, knows implicitly what Welsh’s Nationalism means, but cannot allow himself to reject it... I remember reading you at the time of the vote in 2014, and thinking, that’s interesting. This idea that, if Scotland gets independence and becomes a more social democratic, left, liberal country, maybe people in England will finally wake up. I totally understand that point of view, but I find it very hard. I’m only nationalist when it comes to football. My dad’s influence was to be internationalist. That’s right Bobby, socialism is internationalist NOT nationalist. Yet, earlier this year, In an interview in The Daily Record, and when the polls were in Nationalists’ favour, Gillespie said that \u0027Independence is inevitable\u0027... Scottish independence is coming. We support it… Would love to see a real plan for the future. A radical plan. Way to the left of the SNP. But remember, the E.U. is a neo-liberal construct. It won\u0027t be easy. Ask the Greeks. In a follow-up message, he tried to distance himself from Nationalism:\u0026nbsp; Just to be clear. I am not a nationalist. I come from an international socialist / class politics background. However, I do think that Scottish independence is inevitable. That doesn\u0027t make me a nationalist. There it is again. I’m not a nationalist.\u0026nbsp; Aside from the fact that there is currently no path, no plan and no popular will for a second referendum, much less ‘independence’, one has to wonder: what party is the vehicle for the ‘inevitable’ independence of which he speaks? Not the Tories of course, but it’s also not Labour, who are re-committing themselves to the people of the entire UK. The only viable vehicle for independence is the SNP, a Nationalist party, so does Gillespie support them? If so, he supports Nationalism. But, as he is at pains to tell us, he’s not a Nationalist. It appears Gillespie is trying to have his cake and eat it. Gillespie knows that Nationalism is bad, but still feels he has to pay lip service to it. I feel for him. It’s hard to be a Scottish creative giant (and I’ll include Sharleen, Martin and Andrew as just a few others here) and say you don’t support an ‘independent’ Scotland. Whatever will the fans think? But isn’t Gillespie supposed to be a rebel? Isn’t that where his authenticity springs from?\u0026nbsp; Can we have some clarity, please? Despite Cox’s magical thinking, you cannot get to socialism through Nationalism. When you vote for Nationalists you don\u0027t get more socialism, you get more Nationalism. This is just plain logic.\u0026nbsp; You can\u0027t be a socialist and claim to want equality while supporting the selfish us-and-them politics of Nationalism. They are incompatible. This is also plain logic. Nationalist politicians draw an imaginary border and say that workers in Scotland deserve more than workers in the rest of the UK. Then they push grievance and bigotry, claiming they\u0027re against \u0027Westminster\u0027, but it\u0027s just as much against Newcastle, Manchester and Bristol. This is utterly against socialism. How difficult is it for Gillespie to say: ‘While the idea of Scottish ‘independence’ sounds appealing, the only vehicle for it is Nationalism, which we all know is abhorrent, and has always been abhorrent through history, even when you dress it up in Sturgeon’s smart suits. As a socialist, I reject the us-and-them politics of any kind of nationalism.’? And then some bonus points for talking about the mess Nationalists have made of Scotland. How hard is it for Cox to say the same. And Welsh? And all the rest of those who try to convince us that their Nationalism is ‘progressive’ and decent? It\u0027s well past time that lapsed socialists stopped getting their rocks off on, and actively supporting, the fake socialism of Nationalism. It\u0027s not benign, it\u0027s a cancer. If artists are going to speak out about politics, their audience deserves the same authenticity and rigour that they apply to their work. Their attitude to their work shows that these artists are better than this. It’s time they, and the many others who have taken the same route, realise they are on a false path. They must reject the ugly Nationalism that has fooled them for too long, show leadership, and get back to working for an authentic socialism that benefits the many, not the few.

The young entrepreneur has plans to re-configure running machines in gyms across the country to supply the Scottish National Grid. “It’s a great way to tap into our extensive resources of obesity, after North Sea oil starts running out.” The scheme has received firm backing from the new minister. “This is Scottish belt-tightening at its literal best,” Ms Krankie enthused. “It helps us fulfil our green energy commitments while developing people’s six packs.” The first set of winners offered a wide-ranging showcase for cost-cutting innovation. One Stonehaven company has a newly patented Hyperglue made from the residue of deep fried Mars Bars. “Tons of ochre-brown sludge are thrown away every year, but once we process it, a couple of drops of this stuff could fix Mons Meg onto the Scott Monument,” explained CEO Sam Pritt. “Great if we ever need to bolster our defences!” The aim of the awards is to help independent Scotland get the economy back under control. “We have such amazing talent to inspire us,” Ms Krankie insisted. “We all know that Molly Weir created the flash drive, but how many people realise Sean Connery devised the Martini while delivering milk in Edinburgh? All that shaking without stirring – Scottish innovation at its best.” Transatlantic links are also part of the government recovery strategy. “It’s not just Alexander Graham Bell. Let’s not forget Scott’s discovery of Dilithium Crystals – that really put the warp into warp speed,” the Finance Minister reminded her audience. “It certainly beats all that old fashioned steam engine stuff … y’know … when Scotland was still shackled to Westminster.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Posing for selfies with the winners, the rookie politician was officially presented with her very own certificate, as the world’s youngest guardian of the public purse, by the Guinness Book of Records.

This conflation of the SNP’s fake Gaelicisation, warped morality and waste of taxpayers’ money would have been a gift for opposition politicians and the media in most countries. The fact that it has barely permeated the public consciousness in Scotland, let alone provoked an outcry, is yet another reason why Holyrood needs George Galloway in there speaking out against the SNP’s corruption of society.

The Alliance for Unity picked up a parody account shortly after we set up our Twitter account last July, no doubt part of the SNP’s black ops armoury. In an act of symmetry, another one popped up a few days ago for the final week of the campaign; ‘AllForUnity2’ purported to be a hardline unionist account but we smelt a rat straight away when it posted a meme of British redcoats bayoneting Highlanders at Culloden. Twitter acted quickly and removed the account but it was another reminder of how untruthful politics have become in the post-modernist age. *** It has been an enjoyable challenge finding something location-appropriate to say in each town in a short YouTube video. They are filmed live so there is no room for any bloomers for the Christmas edition. In Hawick, I stand on the soapbox and start, “Today we are in”…..my mind wants to say Langholm as we have just been discussing the birthplace of the Anglophobic nationalist poet Hugh MacDiarmid (not his real name)…but luckily my mouth says, “Hawick”.\u0026nbsp; In Lockerbie, I have an opportunity to talk about the Battle of Dryfe Sands where the Johnstones butchered 700 Maxwells in 1593, a reminder of the sectarian strife that divided the South of Scotland prior to the Union of the Crowns, and which has now been rekindled by Sturgeon’s divisive separatism. Outside Castle Douglas Mart, I am on familiar ground and able to talk about how our livestock industries would be pole-axed by the imposition of a hard border at Gretna. Stranraer provided the backdrop of the Irish Sea and the invisible, but nevertheless real hard border, that stubborn EU negotiators bequeathed as a memento of Brexit.\u0026nbsp; I hope they have given the many thousands of viewers on George’s YouTube channel a window on this forgotten corner of Scotland.

Our opponents, both Nationalist and Unionist, have been keen to promote a narrative that dismisses All for Unity as a party that no one has ever heard of, a ‘Twitter-only party,’ and predicts that we won’t get any votes.\u0026nbsp; Well, if the people who happened to be in the high streets when we passed through are in any way representative, we are going to exceed all expectations. We were astonished by how many people said that they were voting for us. In Hawick, the endless stream of people wanting selfies with George (his Mother of All Talk Shows has a lot of listeners) is completely at odds with the pessimistic narrative – the local café owner even insisted on nabbing one of our posters to put in his window. But the man from the Times who followed us wrote a lukewarm piece in the paper anyway, consisting mainly of Tory quotes accusing us of splitting their vote. This is not just a delusion --\u0026nbsp; the diverse band of malcontents pledging us their votes has barely a Tory among them – it is a conceit.\u0026nbsp; I suspect, though it may never be proved, that when the votes are counted, we will have provided a useful service by gathering up pro-UK votes from across the political spectrum from people who are disenchanted by all the major parties and would otherwise either not have voted, or given their second vote to one of the many no-hoper ‘none of the above’ parties on the list. *** In Loanhead we stop to pay our respects at the Miners’ Memorial.

The young mother in Stranraer spoke for many of them when she spat out the words, “They done nothing for us. Look at it. There’s nothing here for my weans.”\u0026nbsp; Driving through what we assume to be fertile SNP housing schemes, there is a marked absence of yellow posters in windows. Only about one person in thirty waves away our leaflets with the protestation that they are SNP voters. Could the polls be wrong? George has fifty years of campaigning under his belt, including some spectacular upsets in Glasgow, Bradford and Bethnal Green, and is feeling optimistic.\u0026nbsp; If the SNP get back into power on a minority of the vote I will be very angry. The three old unionist parties have spent their time arguing over second, third and fourth places. They have barely contested the constituencies and instead focused on chasing ‘peach votes’ so that their candidates can slide back into their opposition sinecures on the list.\u0026nbsp; The Tories pride themselves on having stopped an outright SNP majority last time, yet the SNP/Green coalition has been far worse for Scotland than when they governed alone.

John Swinney is on Twitter defending his ridiculous demand that MSPs can see a summary of the OECD report on education but cannot copy or quote it. Not only did he make this demand, but he has also now started to claim that he cannot publish the report, despite one of the authors and a senior authority in the subject telling the BBC that there is no reason it cannot be published.\u0026nbsp; Forgive me for not believing a man who lied that legal advice could not be shared before sharing it, who lied about having provided all documents before then providing more, and who has overseen the collapse of our once proud education system.

However, while Grady has stood down, another MP, who has already been named on social media, threatens a lawsuit against anyone who would \"tarnish her good name\", surely an unwinnable position in an election year. Publications, like The Spectator, who already have a history of daring the SNP to react, will simply out her and create another scandal, splashing her face over every front page in the country. One would think that the SNP would want to \"rip the plaster off quickly\", so to speak, and have both of them named, shamed and forgotten as quickly as possible, rather than leaving one to fester under another cover-up which will generate only more bad press closer to the election.\u0026nbsp; Finally, the much detested Hate Crime Bill, passed on a day in which the whole country is reeling from the horrifying murder of a young woman by a police officer, but which has no provision for the protection of women. This bill\u0027s timing, so close to an election and at such a painful moment for our nation, has all the tact and electoral sensitivity of a Nazi-themed orgy at Anne Frank’s house. Yet, the SNP chose to railroad it through, seemingly oblivious to the damage it is causing their election campaign.\u0026nbsp; I am delighted to sit by and watch the SNP tear themselves to pieces, but if I were an SNP supporter, I would be beyond furious. They would be right to ask: why are the SNP intent on self-destruction before an important election? However, unlike some more conspiratorially-minded writers, I do not believe that this damage is a conscious choice by the SNP. Instead, I see it as the callous workings of an out of control, arrogant party, that takes their voters for granted and see themselves impervious to all attacks. They think their steel boots offer plenty of protection from imaginary bullets. But what if the bullets are real and she’s only wearing tartan stilettos?

It\u0027s not like there are few to choose from: from the Nike Cover Up, to the failure to deliver councils their additional funding from Westminster, anti-English racists on the border, the third-worst COVID\u0026nbsp; death rate in the world, and an appalling number of deaths in care homes. Scottish Conservatives inherited a team of thirty one MSPs from Ruth Davidson’s promise to offer Scotland strong opposition. They must work together to deliver that strong opposition or it will cost them, and us, at the next Holyrood elections. #5 Carlaw must lead Whether it’s through tweets or during his performance at First Minister’s Questions, I hold my head in my hands over the lack of opposition that Jackson Carlaw gives the SNP. Simply shouting and pointing the finger at the SNP is not enough to persuade Scotland’s voters that the Conservatives have ideas and proposals of how they would do things differently, to benefit Scots the length and breadth of the country. If I were Jackson Carlaw, I would stop getting pulled into the arguments of the constitution. Scotland’s problems extend further than the constitution. Carlaw has to take the fight back to Nationalists by focusing on the bread and butter issues Scotland cares about – health, education, transport and social care. All of which the SNP have failed Scotland over. #4 Fight for health, education and more The Conservatives must be the alternative to a Government more interested in wasting time on debating whether they should fly the EU Flag, than the terrible state of Scotland\u0027s education, health and transport. In transport, we have seen the embarrassment that is Abellio Scotrail, falling into failure from the word go. Abellio\u0027s Scotrail franchise was terminated three years early over performance issues.\u0026nbsp; In education, we have seen the country slip down world rankings with the diabolical Curriculum for Excellence scheme and the sham that is national qualifications. John Swinney has been a disaster for education, yet even when forced into U-turn after U-turn, the Conservatives can\u0027t seem to touch him. In health, we have seen the Scottish Government failing to meet the majority of their Accident and Emergency targets that they themselves set; and the absolute disgrace that is the Royal Hospital for Children, now scheduled to open in 2021, a whole four years late. And, of course, the many COVID-19 errors. #3 Make a tactical voting plan Tactical voting is a great idea, but it rarely works at an individual level. To stop another four years of Nationalist agitation, we must consider co-ordinated action at the party level. For example, in 2017, in my constituency of Lanark and Hamilton East, the Conservatives received 16,178 votes, just 266 votes less than the SNP\u0027s Angela Crawley\u0027s 16,444 votes. Meanwhile Labour received 16,084 votes. That means just 16,444 Nationalists beat 32,262 anti-Nationalists. Even though, in the same constituency, Nationalists gained 5000 votes in 2019, it\u0027s still less than the number of anti-Nationalists. How is that fair to the voters? Surely, in seats that Labour can\u0027t win they should stand down, and the Tories should do the same in seats where they can\u0027t win. Admittedly, this will be no easy task, but in these times we need novel cross-party solutions that will actually benefit the majority of people who want to see an end to Nationalism in Scotland. #2 Shout out the UK’s pandemic lifelines Sadly, many Scots believe that Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job for Scotland during this pandemic, primarily because the First Minister has turned her daily Coronavirus briefings into an unchallenged party political podcast. Listening to her, you\u0027d think the UK Government had nothing to do with fighting the virus, or was performing poorly. This simply isn\u0027t true. In fact, the UK Government has done an incredible job for Scots during this pandemic. From the Furlough Scheme that has saved nearly one million jobs in Scotland, to the extra £3.6 billion through the Barnett Formula, being part of the UK has protected Scotland from the full economic harm this situation could have caused.\u0026nbsp; However, for Nationalists, these examples are\u0026nbsp; “never good enough”. The Scottish Conservatives must start talking about the positives of being part of a United Kingdom that pools and shares resources, but also ask why Nationalists are never satisfied with the benefits of working together. #1\u0026nbsp; Hammer Sturgeon’s COVID-19 pandemic failures I believe the most important thing Jackson Carlaw and the Scottish Conservatives can do right now is to do everything they can to tell the public about Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s COVID failures. From the Nike Cover Up, where the Scottish Government hid an early viral outbreak that led to many unnecessary infections, through the many failings of Jeane Freeman, to the Care Home Scandal that has led to thousands of unnecessary deaths, and the third worst death rate in the world, the Scottish Government\u0027s answer always seems to be deflection: It wisnae us! Poor Scottish results are always compared with England, which has entirely different conditions, and legitimate questions are stifled by Nicola Sturgeon claiming that her opponents are somehow “playing politics”. I am sorry, but politics must never stop in a democracy. Failure to oppose a party in Government leads to a dictatorial government. It seems hardly anyone in opposition or the media is pressing the Government over what happened and why. Surely, we need a public inquiry into these failings? Surely, we need them to be exposed? Carlaw must tell Sturgeon that she cannot use weasel words and cheap political gimmicks to hide behind her many COVID failures and all Conservative MPs and MSPs must up their game and start opposing hard and fast, before it is too late.

It seems that almost every week there\u0027s a new poll on Scottish \u0027independence\u0027. But, what\u0027s the deal? Why are there so many, and do they really mean we\u0027re on the inevitable road to \u0027independence\u0027? Short answer -- Nope. Here\u0027s how Nationalists manipulate polls, and why. #1 Choose a pollster that gives them the result they want James Kelly (@JamesKelly) of Pop Goes Scot admits that he uses Panelbase polls to get a better result for Yes. https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1351619869050097666 \u0027Panelbase have produced really good results for Yes recently, better than some other firms. Or, I could go with another firm, which might be not be quite so good for Yes, and get a quick result.\u0027 James was all over Twitter trying to claim that the words he said didn\u0027t actually come out of his own mouth. So James chose another pollster and - surprise, surprise - didn\u0027t get the result he wanted: 45% Yes, 43% No and 12% Don\u0027t Knows (who break for No). He tried to spin it, but it was an epic fail. You might think that, when choosing a pollster, accuracy would be more important than trying to get the result you want. Because if you don\u0027t do that, you\u0027ll not only fool people, you\u0027ll make a FOOL of yourself when your predictions fail. Remember this? https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/789083772205600768 Unless your goal is to fool people. In that case, you choose a pollster that gives you the result you want, and get them to ask leading questions. Questions that won\u0027t be asked in a referendum. Questions about a referendum that isn\u0027t even going to happen. #2 Ask questions that won\u0027t be asked Why didn\u0027t James use my poll question? When faced with years of waiting for a second referendum that will never come, while Scottish services continue to go down the toilet, would you rather leave the country now or in six months? Joking (not really) aside, Nationalist pollsters simply don\u0027t want to ask questions about the issues people actually care about: health, education, jobs, economy. And they certainly don\u0027t want to ask questions about a hard border, abandoning the pound and isolation in Europe. But, we have this information, because non-Nationalist pollsters do ask those questions. The latest survey of 1,008 Scots, conducted between September 10 and 12, found that if the pound is replaced with a new Scottish currency, then 42% would be less likely to vote for independence, with 16% more likely, while there would be no difference for 35%.If a hard border is introduced between Scotland and England, then 43% less likely to vote for independence, with 18% more likely, while there would be no difference for 31%.The prospect of an independent Scotland being outside both the UK and the EU for several years would see 42% of Scots become less likely to back independence, while 15% would be more likely and it would make no difference for third (33%).Respondents were then asked how they would vote in a referendum with the question ‘Should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom?’After considering the issues put, 56% said they would vote to remain in the UK and 44% would vote to leave, when undecided voters were excluded. Awkward! Sometimes the terrible truth is revealed inside the detail of Nationalist polls. Here\u0027s what Angus Robertson doesn\u0027t want you to see: For example, even among those who totally, completely support Separation (8 to 10), only 5% support moving to a new Scottish currency in the short term. Few want to abandon the stability of the pound. While Scottish \u0027independence\u0027 is something that many people have a strong feeling for, the reality of Separation is a different matter altogether. And after Brexit, the last thing people want is more constitutional wrangling. A total of 72% said they wanted \u0027s Holyrood election debate to focus on the\u0026nbsp;economy\u0026nbsp;and public\u0026nbsp;services \"ahead of other issues such as Scottish independence\".Among SNP voters in the 2019\u0026nbsp;general election, 35% said a second independence referendum is not a priority while 18% ranked constitutional affairs and independence as a top priority for Scotland. We are being held hostage by 18% of SNP voters. Stop pandering to them and get on with the day job. #3 Ask leading questions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ZZJXw4MTA Check these actual questions, taken from a Panelbase poll last year: Would the following Scenarios make you more or less likely to vote for Scottish independence?If the Scottish Government committed to paying every citizen a universal basic income of £6000 (replacing benefits but OAPs would still get the current pension) a year as part of its economic plans? The UK pension of £134.25 is the lowest in the developed world (OECD Nations) as a percentage of what people earn. If the Scottish Government committed to raising the pension in an independent Scotland to around £330 a week matching the average of OECD/EU countries and end pensioner poverty Sure, if you promise me a free puppy (already toilet trained) then I\u0027ll sign up too. It\u0027s amazing to think that this brazen manipulation actually works, but promising unicorns and rainbows is always at the core of Scottish Nationalism. #4 Always show the results excluding Don\u0027t Knows So apparently we\u0027ve had 21 polls that say independence is coming. Let\u0027s have a look at them in more detail. It\u0027s a fact that Don\u0027t Knows are always excluded from headline results because, when the actual vote comes around they end up voting for the status quo - which means they\u0027ll vote for NO. This means that the best measure of these polls is the results including Don\u0027t Knows. Of those 21 polls, when Don\u0027t Knows are included only five have been over 50% and even then, barely. The others, while showing small leads over NO, are hardly conclusive. #5 Disregard polling that does not suit the agenda Since the referendum there have been approximately 150 polls. Until mid 2020, almost everyone of these had a majority for NO. But, during that time, did we see constant headlines saying, \u0027independence is dead!\u0027? Of course we didn\u0027t. So why are we now, with the numbers being barely different, being subjected to endless articles about the demise of the UK? Just two weeks ago, the Sunday Times did exactly that, spashing \u0027The Union is in Crisis\u0027 headlines across its front page, even though just 49% were in favour of \u0027independence\u0027 and that it was the lowest number in a downward trend. https://twitter.com/thesundaytimes/status/1353043741813202944?lang=en While this might sell newspapers, it\u0027s part of the ongoing appeasement of Scottish Nationalism by our media. Newspapers that woudn\u0027t give the time of day to English Nationalists will gladly promote Scottish Nationalist polls. #6 Claim momentum where there is none 20 polls in a row! 21 polls in a row! Of course, this is simply false. https://twitter.com/ScotNational/status/1359788971019091970 Not that we expect truth from The National, but the poll above actually showed a decline of four percentage points. But the wider conculsion is that, six years on and the needle has barely moved from the 2014 result. As results shift, we can see that the 58% result was an outlier.Another recent poll noted that just 37% of respondents want a Separation referendum in the next two years. There is no momentum. Scottish Nationalsim is a toxic ideology used by weak and incompetent politicians who promise future hope, while betting that the public will overlook their failngs in reality. We see this every day as people continue to say that they will vote for the SNP -- as a vehicle for \u0027independence\u0027 -- despite 14 YEARS of failure, no path to a second referendum, and mounting evidence of corruption from the top of the party down. So what better way to sell that hope than manipulate public opinion, through polls and a compliant media, so that it appears that the end result is inevitable. If it\u0027s inevitable then why not join the crowd? But 50%, plus or minus a few points, using biased and leading questions, isn\u0027t inevitable. It\u0027s a DEAD END. It\u0027s also no surprise that many of these polls appear shortly after some bad news for Nicola Sturgeon. The beleagured First Minister needs any squirrel she can find to divert attention from her government and personal failures. The \u0027independence\u0027 project is now so closely tied with Sturgeon that it lives or dies with her. She was able to use the COVID crisis to her benefit, but as the virus recedes and her corruption and incompetence are further exposed, she will, like all politicians, return to earth, as will the poll results. Maybe then we can get back to politics that doesn\u0027t need biased polls to make their case. Mark Devlin is the publisher of The Majority.

Having spent most of my life running my own businesses, in Japan, the United States and now in Scotland, it makes me really angry to see how the Scottish Government treats businesses here in Scotland.\u0026nbsp; I remember starting my first business in Tokyo, making what became Japan’s number one English magazine. Like a lot of business owners, we used all our savings to get started. It wasn’t enough, but we worked really hard and took huge risks, taking on credit and debt. Slowly, over many years we built a profitable business employing 40 people. It was hard work, extremely stressful and full of risk—which is why I really feel for a lot of businesses in Scotland today. Our current Scottish Government just doesn’t seem to understand how businesses work, or the consequences of their often ad hoc policies. But then again, how could they? Most of the ministers and Scottish cabinet members have either never worked - or barely ever worked - in a business. None of the people in Scottish Government making decisions for Scottish businesses have ever grown a successful business of their own or knows what it takes to create jobs. Nicola Sturgeon was a solicitor. Kate Forbes, our Finance Minister—in charge of a £32 billion annual budget—is a 30 year old, whose total finance and work experience is working for two years in a bank. Who in their right minds ever thought someone with two years’ junior experience, should be in charge of running a national budget? If I had a small company with three or four employees, and I was looking for someone to take care of our accounts, she wouldn’t even be asked for an interview. She doesn’t have the skills or the experience. Our Economy Secretary, Fiona Hyslop is a long-term politician for over 20 years, and my counterpart in the SNP, Minister for Business, Jamie Hepburn, has never worked in a business, never mind grown one himself, and he has never created jobs. He, like so many of his colleagues in the SNP, is a career politician: They study history or politics at university, never work in the real world, but are happy to keep on collecting their generous salaries and expenses.\u0026nbsp; During my over 30 years of working in multinationals and running my own companies, I have learned a lot about what it takes to employ people and keep a business running. I know how hard it can be. Cashflow is king. I spent every day for years making decisions based on when money was coming in and when it had to be paid out. Our SNP politicians have never had to do this. Kate Forbes has never had to do this in earnest. Scotland’s shortfall of £2billion a year is financed by the UK Government.\u0026nbsp; Has Kate Forbes, or Fiona Hyslop, Jamie Hepburn or even Nicola Sturgeon ever had sleepless nights wondering how to keep a business going, how to retain staff, how to meet the payroll, how to pay the loans and creditors, how to keep costs down and profits up?\u0026nbsp; This is why, when Nicola Sturgeon ordered most of Scotland’s bars and restaurants to close with less than two days notice, I watched and listened with astonishment and anger. Of course we are in a pandemic and common sense measures need to be taken but, what we don’t need, is arbitrary, ad hoc policies targeted solely at a particular sector, with little and very contradictory evidence on whether closing them will even curtail\u0026nbsp;the virus.\u0026nbsp; The hospitality industry employs over 200,000 people and contributes 4 billion pounds a year to the Scottish economy. What Nicola and her astoundingly inexperienced colleagues fail to understand is that you can’t just order a business to close, and then expect them to open up again at some undetermined time in the future. Sadly, many of these businesses will never open again and the consequences of that will be painful - not just for them, but for all of us.\u0026nbsp; Scottish industry and businesses are the engine of the economy. They should not be tinkered with by amateurs. I know very well how it feels to think you might be about to lose your business; that overwhelming gut-wrenching feeling, the extreme stress and anxiety and all the fears of the consequences that go with it, like losing your home and only income. This week a client of mine, an award-winning restaurant owner in Glasgow, posted a video on Facebook, showing many of the boarded up and permanently closed bars and restaurants in Glasgow. It is quite hard to watch. In the video he says, “The Government has imposed a lockdown on us and I don’t understand how it makes sense. We have absolutely no idea how to survive.” Nicola Sturgeon has promised to pay out £40 million to the hospitality businesses affected, but how and when? The Scottish Government is already sitting on £1 billion the UK Government sent for Scottish businesses, which they haven’t received. Where is the money and when will it be distributed to the many businesses who need it so desperately? These businesses need to be compensated fairly by the Scottish Government and they need to receive the money in days - not weeks or months.\u0026nbsp; Most people start a business to take control of their own destiny, but now we have a government that is pulling the rug from under their feet, just when they have worked hard and spent a lot of money to comply with every safety regulation and every piece of advice the Government has given them. I have been back in Scotland for nearly five years now, and I am appalled at the number of incompetent, inexperienced, unqualified and “hard of thinking” Nationalist MSPs we have in the Scottish Government these days. There is no one at the centre of power in Scotland who is looking out for the interests of business. Earlier in the summer, Sir Tom Hunter advised having a lead business advisor having as much access to decision-making as the medical and scientific advisors. That role could perhaps have been filled by Steve Dunlop, the leader of Scottish Enterprise, but he has just resigned. Leading business figures reveal a consistent picture of frustration, a lack of trust and poor communication with the Government, that has deteriorated rapidly during this pandemic. The Scotland I left was a very different place from the Scotland of today. I am increasingly alarmed at rising Nationalism in Scotland, and the possibility of the SNP increasing their seats at the election next May. They will use this to claim a mandate for another referendum for separation from the UK, which would be a disaster on every level - economically and socially.\u0026nbsp; I joined Alliance for Unity because I admire my fellow candidates.

These dismissals follow the same forms: GERS is produced by the UK Government to discredit Scotland GERS does not give a real picture of Scotland’s finances These are followed by two self-serving arguments: Scotland’s oil and gas subsidises the rest of the UK If that’s not the case, then why doesn\u0027t the UK let Scotland go? Who produces GERS? It takes but a few seconds to find out who produces GERS. From the Scottish Government’s website:\u0026nbsp; Who produces GERS? GERS is produced by Scottish Government statisticians. It is designated as a National Statistics product, which means that it is produced independently of Scottish Ministers and has been assessed by the UK Statistics Authority as being produced in line with the Code of Practice for Statistics. This means the statistics have been found to meet user needs, to be methodologically sound, explained well and produced free of political interference. That’s more than clear enough. There is no UK plot: the statistics are free of UK and Scottish Government interference. So we’ll move on to the numbers. What does GERS say? The core finding is the same as in recent years: Scotland spends more on public services than it raises in taxes. Scotland spends £112 billion on public services, but raises only £86 billion in taxes. This leads to a nominal deficit of just under £23 billion. The UK Government pays the entire £112 billion, covering the shortfall. In other words, Scotland gets £23 billion extra per year more than it raises for Scotland’s public services.\u0026nbsp; Scotland makes up around 8.2% of the total UK population, but 9.1% of UK public spending was in Scotland. Although some excess may be expected, due to the remoteness of many communities in Scotland, the Scottish Government does not need to fund defence, international affairs and other reserved matters. This means that every person in Scotland gets £2,417 more than the UK average, helping to protect the NHS, schools, and communities.\u0026nbsp; Where does the money come from? This deficit is covered by taxpayers outside of Scotland, primarily those who are living in London and the South East of England. Scotland had an estimated nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of £218 billion. By contrast, the GDP of London (including London City and the wider metropolitan area) is slightly more than £1.5 trillion. London’s GDP is over nine times bigger than Scotland\u0027s GDP. That GDP generates more taxes and those taxes are spent in the rest of the UK. If Scotland is such a drag, why don’t they let us go? This is surely the most tiresome of all dismissals. First of all, who are ‘they’? Of course, the implication is that ‘they’ are the English. However, the decision to fund Scotland is taken by representatives of the entire UK, in the UK Parliament, by the UK Government. This dismissal is made by those who don’t believe in GERS. They think that the English are holding on to Scotland because of its ‘rich resources’. How many times have we seen the meme that gives a list of Scottish resources, from water, through forestry to, of course, oil, that somehow prove that Scotland is a rich country. But these resources mean nothing if they don\u0027t generate taxes. GERS is the measure of those taxes, and, despite all those resources, there still isn\u0027t enough taxation to cover spending. But, if we’re talking about regional deficits, why don\u0027t \u0027they\u0027 also let go: The North of England, Cornwall, Wales, Northern Ireland and anywhere else outside London and The South East, because they are all supported by the latter two regions’ tax revenues.\u0026nbsp; But surely ‘oor oil’ is supporting the rest of the UK? The oil argument is yet another SNP-sponsored myth, like their often repeated ‘Scotland subsidises England’ assertion. Of the £218 billion GDP mentioned above, just £4 billion comes from oil and gas extraction.\u0026nbsp; But, more importantly, it wouldn’t matter if Scotland contributed £100 billion. The oil never ‘belonged’ to Scotland. It was, and is, UK oil. It was, and is, in UK territorial waters. It was, and is, licensed for extraction by the UK Government, and was, and is, taxed by the UK Government. The oil argument is one purely based on greed: \u0027Our region of the UK has become rich, but instead of sharing with the rest of the UK, we want to separate, build a wall between us, and keep the money for ourselves.\u0027 Despite oil revenues dwindling to a trickle, nationalists are still trying to say Scotland is stealing, although, these days, it has moved on to\u0026nbsp; water and electricity. This is because the underlying psychology that drives nationalism is greed. Greedy people always think someone is stealing from them. Usually, though, it doesn’t become an entire political movement. We are actually better together GERS underlines the collective economic strength of being in the United Kingdom. The pooling and sharing of resources across the UK means that Scots benefit by £2,417 more per head in public spending than the UK average, which equates to substantially more money for schools, hospitals and other public services.\u0026nbsp; Separating Scotland from the rest of the UK would mean the end of such fiscal transfers and so, vastly less money for Scotland\u0027s public services, coupled with ultra-austerity in order to finance the risible services that would exist. England, or the UK, doesn’t steal Scotland’s money. Scotland pays its share into the collective UK pot, like England, Wales and Northern Ireland do, and that significantly increases the UK’s overall economic standing in the world by several places. But it is important to note that the UK is not a collection of regions held together by fiscal transfers. In addition to our shared financial support, the UK benefits hugely from shared political, social, cultural, and military institutions and heritage. They deny it because it’s real Separatists deny GERS because the truth hurts. Rather than create a plan for economic growth, they would rather mislead their followers by indulging their grievances that the English are stealing from Scots, when in fact, nationalists are the ungrateful recipients of financial transfers that can only happen by pooling and sharing across the entire UK. It’s time they stopped denying reality and put their greed-driven fantasies and Anglophobia away.

Both have attempted to frame support among 16- to 24-year-olds as proof of an inevitable shift toward separation from the United Kingdom. In a recent speech at the SNP’s conference, Swinney cited a poll commissioned by The National—the nationalists\u0027 propaganda paper —which claimed 63% of 16- to 24-year-olds backed independence. However, he went further, misleading MSPs at Holyrood by implying this figure represented overall support for independence across all age groups. In truth, the majority exists only within that youngest demographic. Sturgeon made similar claims in a television interview, again focusing narrowly on youth opinion. This framing is misleading. A closer look at the empirical data over the past decade suggests that the demographic case for separation is far less convincing than the SNP asserts. A Decade of Stagnation Following the 2014 referendum, polling by YouGov provided detailed insight into how various age groups voted. Contrary to nationalist claims, the data showed a nuanced picture: Among 16- to 24-year-olds, there was a slight majority against independence. Support for the UK was just under 50%, with pro-independence sentiment trailing by a few percentage points. The 25–39 age group showed the highest level of support for independence, though only by a narrow margin. In the 40–59 and 60–64 brackets, slim majorities favoured remaining in the Union. Among those aged 65 and over, a decisive 65% supported the Union. These figures undermined the suggestion that youth support represented an overwhelming or inevitable tide in favour of separation. Indeed, the youngest cohort—those whom the SNP most frequently cite—were, at the time, marginally more pro-UK than not. Fast-forward a decade to 2024, and the numbers remain strikingly similar. A fresh YouGov poll indicates that the overall balance of opinion has barely shifted since 2014. The survey finds that: 56% of Scots would now vote No in another referendum, with 44% backing Yes—virtually unchanged from the 2014 result. The pro-UK side has maintained its lead in the majority of polls conducted over the past ten years. The Yes side briefly edged ahead only on a handful of occasions. Support for separation has peaked at 53% just twice—once in August 2020 and again in December 2022—and dipped as low as 43% on three separate occasions between 2017 and 2018. Crucially, voter retention also favours the UK. Only 70% of those who backed Yes in 2014 still support separation today, with 18% having changed their minds. By contrast, 79% of No voters remain committed to the Union, and only 11% have switched sides. This trend reinforces an uncomfortable truth for the SNP: support for independence has proven volatile, while backing for the Union has remained comparatively stable. The SNP’s repeated invocation of youthful enthusiasm masks a broader demographic reality—the supposed inevitability of independence remains just that: supposed. The Art of Manipulation Faced with a lack of clear momentum, nationalist leaders have turned to well-honed techniques of political manipulation to create the illusion of inevitability. Chief among these is poll cherry-picking. The SNP frequently highlights only those surveys favourable to their cause—often omitting sample size, methodology, or margin of error—and ignores the broader trend of consistently Unionist majorities over the past decade. Another common tactic is the strategic conflation of demographics and destiny. By isolating age brackets where independence appears more popular (such as among 16- to 24-year-olds), nationalists suggest that older, more pro-UK voters will simply \"age out\" of the electorate, allowing Scotland to drift naturally toward separation. This overlooks two key realities: first, many young Scots become more moderate with age, and second, support for breaking up the UK among youth is neither overwhelming nor stable. The 2014 referendum showed a plurality of young voters chose to remain in the Union. The SNP also engages in emotive framing, painting independence as a moral imperative rather than a policy choice. By characterising critics as anti-Scottish or unpatriotic, they shut down debate and polarise discourse—substituting sentiment for substance. In speeches and party literature, the language of oppression, \"colonial rule,\" and \"taking back control\" is frequently deployed, despite the devolution settlement granting Scotland significant autonomy unmatched in most federal systems. More subtly, there is the tactic of false precision—presenting a single data point (such as a favourable 63% figure among 16- to 24-year-olds) as if it represents a robust, cross-sectional national trend. In fact, polling across other age groups tells a very different story, one that complicates the nationalist narrative considerably. Finally, nationalists often present volatility as momentum. Temporary spikes in support—frequently triggered by external events such as Brexit or scandals at Westminster—are touted as proof of an irreversible trend. Yet when support ebbs, as it invariably does, the movement quickly pivots back to vague notions of inevitability and destiny. These techniques are not merely rhetorical flourishes—they represent a strategic attempt to manufacture consensus in the absence of one. But the facts remain stubborn. Scotland is not drifting inevitably toward independence. If anything, the mood is stalled. The Numbers Don’t Lie Despite relentless rhetoric from nationalist leaders and sympathetic coverage in their in-house propaganda paper, The National, the empirical data offers no grounds for triumphalism. The pro-UK position has not only held steady but in some respects has strengthened, as key segments of the electorate have drifted away from the separatist cause. The data suggests that Scottish independence is not the foregone conclusion the SNP would like to portray. It remains, a decade on from the referendum, a deeply divisive issue with little substantive change in public opinion. Far from being an unstoppable demographic force, support for separation appears stuck in neutral—animated by political theatre, but unconfirmed by the numbers.Written by Stephen Bailey.

A couple of weeks ago, Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said that Scots could have a second ‘independence’ referendum if polls showed a consistent majority of 60% of Scots in favour of it. Gambling your country\u0027s future on the basis of opinion polls is certainly an interesting strategy, but, as I was getting ready to publish this article, the UK Government finally pushed back on Jack’s comments, saying, ‘We’ve never set a position on that. We haven’t said any sort of target. Our view, as set out, is that now is simply not the time to be dealing with this.’\u0026nbsp; While it’s good to see Jack’s gambit sidelined, why is breaking up the UK a matter for a later time? Why has no-one mentioned that 48% of No voters and 62% of Conservatives think there should never be another referendum again? Why is every headline written as ‘the Union is in peril!’ when polls are now consistently against separation? Because, those in power and in the media consistently appease separatism, by letting separatists define the narrative, the terms of engagement and where the battle is fought.\u0026nbsp; Consider the questions: ‘Are you in favour of Scottish independence?’ and ‘Are you in favour of the break up of the UK?’ These are the same thing, yet we are always asked the former, rather than the latter. The first appeals to emotion (who doesn’t want to be ‘free’?) while the second requires much deeper thought. What does the break up of the UK mean - territorially, economically, culturally and socially? But, reframing the question doesn’t just change the answers; it changes the scope of who is asked. The break up of the UK isn’t a question just for Scots; it becomes a question for all citizens of the UK. When the question is reframed, it becomes obvious that even if Scottish Nationalists achieved Alister Jack’s 60% support in polls, the UK shouldn’t risk being broken up by just 6% of its population. No country would, or should, allow itself to be broken up by the whim of a tiny minority of separatists. Nationalist narratives are so pervasive that it might come as a surprise that the devolved administrations were not actually set up as ‘motorways to independence without any exits’ (as Tam Dalyell famously said), but were actually set up to - get this - improve the quality of services for the people of those regions.\u0026nbsp; Yet, today, like every other day, we hear Nicola Sturgeon use her platform as the leader of the devolved Scottish administration, to agitate for a second referendum. In the recent Holyrood elections she even said that a vote for her was not a vote for a second referendum, only to turn around the day after the election and claim it was.\u0026nbsp; But a vote for any party in the Scottish elections cannot be claimed as a vote for a referendum because The Scotland Act is clear that the Scottish devolved administration does not have the authority to call such a referendum. The power to hold referendums on the constitution, indeed the power to hold a referendum on Breaking Up The UK, is one rightly held by the UK Government alone. Because the UK Government is not willing to stand up for the UK and the majority of Scots who voted to remain in the UK in 2014 (the only part of the UK that has actually voted to stay in it), Scotland finds itself in a constant state of ‘Neverendum’, which has two major costs. Firstly, political uncertainty kills inward investment. Who is going to invest in a devolved region, if they don’t know what its currency, borders and economy is going to look like in five years? Secondly, it gives cover to the SNP and their co-conspirators, The Scottish Greens, to avoid scrutiny. Take their recent power-sharing announcement, which didn’t focus on green issues or health, jobs or economy, but focussed almost exclusively on a ‘mandate’ for a second referendum. A mandate that is meaningless, because the devolved administration has no authority to hold a referendum on constitutional issues.\u0026nbsp; Remove the threat of a second referendum and the SNP and Greens would not be able to hide behind false promises while Scotland’s services sink ever lower. They would have to work with Westminster, instead of constantly agitating against it. There has been talk of implementing a Canada-style ‘Clarity Act’ which would set out the conditions through which a future referendum could occur. But again, this is still playing the separatists\u0027 game. Arguing about the details of such an Act will let separatists manufacture grievances on every point. And why become a hostage to fortune? If a poll of Londoners said that 60% of the city wanted to leave the UK, should they be given a referendum to leave? Should any region? Of course not, so why should Scots get extra constitutional gifts? We act decisively against those who would destroy our country from outside, so let’s stop giving free reign to those who would destroy it from the inside. The UK Government should use its 80-seat majority to ban secession now. Any party that advocates for secession or that misuses funds on activities related to secession, be it in the devolved administrations or in the UK Parliament, should have its UK funding stopped. Banning secession, like many other countries do, would allow devolution to actually work, instead of being a vehicle for weak and incompetent politicians to push grievance and separation. It would stop the Neverendum and create a stable environment for investment. It would force politicians to be accountable for providing services. It would stop the UK constantly being held hostage by a minority of separatists. It would strengthen devolution and strengthen the UK. Separatists were foolishly given their chance to destroy the UK in 2014. Thankfully, they lost. Now it’s time to stop them creating further constitutional uncertainty once and for all. The UK government should assert its primacy, stop gambling with its territorial, economic, cultural and social integrity, and protect the UK. We are one country.\u0026nbsp; No more talk of setting conditions based on random percentages and no more indulgence of separatist narratives like the length of a generation or weasel words like ‘now is not the right time’ or ‘perhaps after the pandemic’ that imply there’s still a chance. No more appeasement. The answer should always be not simply ‘No’, but ‘That’s impossible, we don’t give up on our country’. Mark Devlin is the publisher of The Majority.

The Potemkin Villages, as they became known, were the means by which the gilded monarch was persuaded that all was right with the country under her gaze even though the truth was the opposite.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; More than two centuries later in Scotland, former SNP MSP and businessman Andrew Wilson flatters to deceive by doing something of a ‘reverse Potemkin’ on anyone in the business community who cares to listen, on behalf of his pro-independence pals. Writing in the Financial Times last weekend, Mr Wilson, a former RBS economist under the tenure of Fred Goodwin and later chair of the Scottish Government’s Sustainable Growth Commission, aimed to show why separation between Scotland and the rest of the UK made economic sense. In the article, Brexit is described as “a populist campaign without any prospectus or detail on what would happen next”, before we hear in beguilingly optimistic terms what might happen if the SNP’s own populist campaign succeeds.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; In doing so we are required to forget what we know about robust economic decision-making in favour of a ‘cut and run’ approach to the UK that many business leaders here in Scotland find frankly stomach-churning.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; In fact, the economic vision proposed is far more poorly focused than the FT’s readers would be led to believe. The Commission chaired by Mr Wilson was disbanded several years ago, its findings ignored by business and rejected by many on the left of the party. As an attempt by Nicola Sturgeon to subcontract thinking on economic policy to an ‘independent’ body though, it was a useful exercise in trying to show her party was at last grappling with the task of creating some sort of coherent economic case for separation.\u0026nbsp; Put simply, Ms Sturgeon’s government is renowned by business leaders in Scotland for its cluelessness in understanding what makes them tick. So this arms-length approach was useful because its authors, including Mr Wilson, lent the exercise a veneer of authenticity. A useful PR exercise then; an elaborate Potemkin Village erected to impress voters turned off by the confusion of the Yes campaign’s economic case in 2014. Little more though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; What we’re now being asked to believe is that the SNP is being refreshingly honest because it admits that there will be “trade-offs and challenges” on a range of economic issues. Yet on everything from the need for a new currency to borders, deficit reduction plans and the path of future alignment with the EU, those challenges are glided over.\u0026nbsp; In truth Mr Wilson’s Potemkin vision of a post-separation economy shorn of rough edges at the behest of an arrogant political leadership was always a cynical tool. From the perspective of Scottish businesses coping with pandemic it is utterly valueless.\u0026nbsp; This ‘cut and run’ strategy ruthlessly exploits ill-feeling in Scotland about Brexit on one hand and the pandemic on the other to pursue a referendum at the worst possible time for our shared economic future. Scotland’s business owners are acutely aware that it is HM Treasury payments that are supporting payroll and other operating costs while keeping devolved coffers topped up to the tune of £8.6bn in additional revenue since the start of the pandemic. Yet worryingly, most voters aren’t.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; According to a recent YouGov poll, 30 per cent of Scots believe the money spent in Scotland on Covid support for businesses and employees comes from the Scottish government, while only 21 per cent believe that it originates in Westminster. It is clear that there is deep and growing confusion about the role of the UK in improving the lives of people in Scotland, which risks feeding into an unquestioning acceptance of the case put forward by the Scottish government in the event of any future referendum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It will never admit it but the SNP thrives on such confusion.\u0026nbsp; In turn, the need to set the record straight places a duty and responsibility on politicians, business leaders and other supporters of Scotland’s place in the UK to ensure that the facts are known. This is a point in our history when the UK\u0027s role has rarely been more visible and relevant in the collective task we face of sustaining the economy and giving businesses the capacity to gather strength for future recovery.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Nothing about the SNP’s Potemkin prospectus for separation makes sense by contrast.

Nicola Sturgeon definitely merits a chapter in a book on European leadership. It isn’t because she left Scotland a better place than she found it or because under her the independence cause flourished. Neither thing happened. Indeed, many of the 12,000 people who crowded into Scotland’s main events venue, the Hydro in Glasgow on 22 November 2014 to hail her emergence as First Minister of devolved Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) would today bitterly assail her as a fraud who had duped them. Her low standing in the pantheon of Scottish Nationalism is shown by the fact that the family of the recently deceased, Winifred Ewing the architect of the nationalist breakthrough in Scotland, have delivered a pointed snub to her. Instead of being asked to deliver a tribute at her memorial service in Inverness Cathedral later this month, the honour goes instead to two of her fiercest detractors in the increasingly divided independence movement, Alex Salmond and Alex Neil. Mrs Ewing is famous for having said ‘Stop the world, Scotland wants to get on’. Arguably, under Sturgeon a furious effort was made to locate Scotland in the fractious and weird world of left-wing student union politics. She turned her cause into a vanguard movement ready to embrace increasingly unconventional ideas for re-engineering humanity, or at least the portion calling itself Scottish. She was outspoken about the desirability of wishing to repudiate existing identities based on the nuclear family, nation, or class in favour of ones advanced by those who presume to speak for submerged and oppressed minorities. But her ambition was greater than her reach. She was an unoriginal thinker who relied on a small army of spin doctors to carve out an image as a semi-Renaissance figure absorbed by books, theatre and a medley of contemporary ideas. She micro-managed areas of government that she felt could strengthen her profile but accumulating problems, ranging from an ailing health service, mounting drug deaths, costly procurement failures, and underperforming schools, blighted her eight years running Scotland’s internal affairs. Looking back, it is still remarkable to observe how she ensured that her party just became an appendage to her rule. It was no mean feat to accomplish that and it has left scars that may be impossible to heal. She sought validation from global forces using wealth and power in a bid to socially re-engineer humanity. This meant noisily jumping on various fashionable bandwagons. She and her party thrived thanks to the arrival of social media which admired edgy radical causes. Her rise and fall saw her sharing major decision-making roles with Alex Salmond up to the 2014 independence role, to her succession I 2014, followed by a barely-concealed attempt to liquidate him politically in what proved a messily brutal but unsuccessful operation. Seen in European terms, it is remarkable that she hung on for so long, given her absence of political realism, her unwillingness to compromise and her lack of respect for governing expertise. Her propaganda service extolled her as a European leader but, in reality, it is hard to find another European leader as visible as her who was so lacking in elementary leadership skills. In France, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands, parties that were once household names have died or nearly vanished after many years at the top. Radical alternatives wait in the wings (or have already taken over as in Italy) while saviours with Sturgeon’s ambition and lack of reach, like Macron, struggle to avoid being swept away.\u0026nbsp; It will take some time to assess the true significance of a ruthless, dour and abrasive leader like Sturgeon. But some things are already obvious. She was the beneficiary of the mistakes and over-reach of the SNP’s chief opponents. The growing professionalism of the SNP enabled these altered political conditions to be turned to its advantage. Despite regular descents on European capitals during the Brexit years, it wasn’t the cause of European integration but political events in London that absorbed Sturgeon’s attention. Under her, the SNP with its emphasis on personality and its absorption with presentation and expanding its influence across state and society, increasingly came to be a north British version of New Labour rather than a fresh Scottish political force. Sturgeon sought legitimacy in ways that had been tried out by rulers in London with distinctly mixed results. Like Labour she sought to build an appealing brand by reaching out to figures in the entertainment fields and cultivated business types, but only for most to grow wary about her intentions. The state was also expanded into areas of public life where neutrality once reigned. Just like Labour she was unable to devise an alternative project, one that, in her case, would differentiate Scotland from developments in the rest of Britain. She left the mainly working-class voters, who had given the SNP big majorities in 2011 and 2015, far behind. The disenchanted post-industrial Scots with poor health standards and economic prospects, remained deprived and overlooked. Like Labour under Blair, her rule was increasingly middle-class in focus. The lifestyles, and habits of ordinary Scots (especially the younger ones) were increasingly managed and policed by an interventionist state. Europe\u0027s Leadership Famine Tom Gallagher\u0027s new book examines the careers, formative experiences, outlooks and intentions of twenty European leaders, from Tito to Macron, from Sturgeon to Zelensky, in five thematic sections, from The Cold War through identity politics and renewed war in Europe. Most of these leaders left their countries weaker. A small number at times sought to defy networks of power or patterns of thought that diminished Europe and corroded democracy. How can Europe remain mostly free and adequately governed, if this leadership famine drags on? She eagerly adopted Green transport and industrial and health restrictions that, as during the pandemic, seemed designed to crush the autonomy of citizens. In the process her party ceased to count. Sturgeon was listless about using years of turmoil and gridlock at Westminster to try and bring independence nearer. The campaigns upon which she lavished her time, state resources and large amounts of legislation, were fashionable ones imported from West Coast America or London. The Me Too movement, urban-inspired Green causes, the pro-EU Remain cause and latterly gender ideology enabled her to latch on to counter-culture icons like Greta Thunberg.\u0026nbsp; Despite running a tightly centralised administration, she argued that she was taking on oppressive forces of authority that stood in the way of a progressive transformation that young people in particular could benefit from. But her 2022 Gender Recognition Reform bill, whose aim was to allow persons as young as sixteen to alter their gender without the need for a medical diagnosis, was viewed as a grave setback for womens’ rights and sparked turmoil in her party and in Scottish society, contributing to her downfall. Critics argued that by promoting fashionable causes approved by the media and corporate moguls, she was essentially promoting herself and badly damaging the SNP’s independence cause. Her dogmatism in pursuing some of the most controversial features of this progressive agenda reflected the tenor of much of the discussion about the contemporary world in academia and the media. But she was not operating in a university sociology department or a sprawling human resources office. Ultimately, she had to persuade rather than browbeat public opinion. She was simply too unsubtle and intimidating at times to be an effective recruiter for the various new dogmas for post-modern living. She had already shown herself to be too blinkered and short-term in the way she approached the eternal struggle to prise yet more political power from London. Sturgeon seemed to be a forerunner of the type of politician preferred by the World Economic Forum or the Soros Foundation if carefully elected Citizens Assemblies rather than elections determined who ought to be the rulers. She is now likely to concentrate on forays into biography. But the portraits that will prove durable are likely to be the ones that shed light on the personal and psychological conflicts that made her an exacting colleague and a leader avid to disrupt rather than improve society. Hubristic politicians obsessed with their own personal destiny, and who sometimes view humanity itself as an onerous burden and an obstacle to progress, are increasingly noticeable in different parts of the English-speaking world. Scotland has little to congratulate itself about so far this century. But it should take a bow for casting into the political wilderness someone as ill-equipped to be a democratic leader as Nicola Sturgeon.

When it comes to Coronavirus data, when it comes to education, when it comes to the Alex Salmond issue. There is a gap between how you present yourself - very, very effectively - and what’s really been going on in Scotland.Andrew Marr, questioning Nicola Sturgeon - 29th November, 2020 https://twitter.com/addicted2newz/status/1332995168727928832 Not long after Nicola Sturgeon made the promise of a (UK funded) £500-pound tax-free bonus to all NHS staff at the annual SNP rally, the real intent of her words was made clear.\u0026nbsp; Thanking NHS staff for their service was secondary; her primary goal was to manufacture grievance against the UK government, yet again, with the absurd claim that the UK Government, which is providing the funds, should exempt the payment from taxation.\u0026nbsp; In using health workers as pawns in her constitutional game, she broke the most fundamental ethical rule -- Kant’s Formula of Humanity -- on which countless faiths and systems of government have been based: it is wrong to use people as a means to an end. So act that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.\u0027 Immanuel Kant, 1785 The move fell flat within hours, as opposition parties, the public and experts called her out, and in many cases even presented her with ways to\u0026nbsp;make good on her promise.\u0026nbsp; Sturgeon used the bravery of our frontline medical workers to score a cheap political point,\u0026nbsp; forgetting the equally heroic struggles of the countless individuals who work tirelessly every day to maintain our standards of living and our way of life: the cleaning staff; lorry drivers; supermarket workers; police; fire and rescue services; the armed forces and many more. All forgotten by the SNP as they play their tired tune of constitutional grievance.\u0026nbsp; It has become abundantly clear that the SNP treat all of the residents of these islands as little more than stepping stones for their narcissistic obsessions. For us in Scotland, we are simply voters to be agitated. People in the other home countries are simply to be antagonised to the extent that they want shot of us, simply to shut her up.\u0026nbsp; The SNP do not care for us, nor for them. They only care for their own power, through separatism, and maintaining and promoting their lies and fairy tales, and fantasies of building statues to themselves in their dreamy Utopia. The SNP are a broken, yet predictable, record whose sole track is that of endless circular reasoning. Regardless of the question, the answer is independence. Solve the pandemic and its catastrophic economic and social fall out: independence. Tackle the climate crisis: only after independence. Fix housing, jobs, education, healthcare: yes, but only after independence.\u0026nbsp; While Rome burns, they spend their time playing imaginary fiddles. There isn’t a problem in Scotland that they don’t already have the power to fix, but they cannot be seen to let Devolution succeed. And so they must break it, and break us along with it.\u0026nbsp; For far too long, the SNP have treated those who oppose them, and even those who support them, with utter contempt, displaying all of the worst traits of political elitism and detached arrogance, which they say they are fighting against. They are determined to follow in the footsteps of the last party who held the “commanding heights” of the Scottish electorate. This is the pride that comes before the very well-deserved fall.\u0026nbsp; With Sturgeon and The SNP it is always style and never substance. Their pledge for green investment and sustainable jobs:\u0026nbsp;Failed. Their forays into shipbuilding, once the pride of Scotland:\u0026nbsp;Failed.

Still, each, in turn, showed a catastrophic lack of substance as they collapsed around us, taking our livelihoods, futures and security along with them.\u0026nbsp; The SNP have broken the most fundamental commandment, never to use people as a means to an end; they have sacrificed us on the altars of their ego.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Chancellor of Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, delivered a typically impressive performance in the House of Commons. Outlining the next phase of governmental support for the British people, he spoke passionately about protecting livelihoods before announcing an imaginative set of measures intended to kick-start the UK economy. The\u0026nbsp;speech\u0026nbsp;– entitled ‘A Plan for Jobs’ – contained several notable soundbites. The measures themselves were eye-catching, with a floundering hospitality sector receiving special attention in the form of a VAT reduction and a new policy dubbed ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ – cue much innuendo on Twitter. Aside from those points of policy, another part of the speech caught the attention from a Scottish perspective. It read like a piece of poetry. “No nationalist can ignore the undeniable truth: this help has only been possible because we are a United Kingdom” This riposte was particularly pleasing to hear given the incessant politicking of Scotland’s secessionist movement throughout the Coronavirus outbreak. As someone who is fiercely proud of Scotland’s place in our United Kingdom, it was satisfying to see the Chancellor place the SNP – and indeed the Welsh nationalists – back into their box with a not-so-gentle pat on the head. The comment was never likely to go down well with Scottish nationalists, but then what’s new? There isn’t a sentence to be uttered by an English politician that would elicit anything other than a contemptuous response from those who wish to partition Scotland. True to form, It didn’t take long for the SNP to find fault with Mr Sunak’s blueprint. Holyrood’s Finance Secretary, Kate Forbes, immediately tweeted a disingenuous attack line bemoaning the percentile of the overall £30bn purse that would be administered by the Scottish Government. This tweet is so telling in that it deliberately attempts to conflate the Scottish Executive and the Scottish people themselves. A classic move straight out of the nationalist playbook. It’s a very deliberate tactic to portray Scots as being given a low level of support by the UK Government. Think about\u0026nbsp;why\u0026nbsp;they’re upset for a moment. The SNP is having a tantrum because the British Government has the audacity to use reserved powers to support millions of Scots\u0026nbsp;directly, without having to involve the SNP at Holyrood. This petty petulance is par for the course when it comes to the SNP. It’s been woven into the First Minister’s approach to fighting Coronavirus from the start. Where an opportunity to diverge from the UK-wide strategy has presented itself, Ms Sturgeon has taken it with gusto. Across Scotland, ordinary people joke about waiting a fortnight and receiving a carbon-copy of Boris Johnson’s announcement but with tartan ribbons ‘round it. The result is a sustained period of lockdown. Aside from the above, Kate Forbes’ comments are factually incorrect in that they ignore the impact of Barnett consequentials. But the truth is a mere inconvenience when there’s a grievance in play. It’s high time that Scotland’s anti-nationalist opposition parties effectively held the First Minister and her tired administration to account on these matters. That means calling out their ‘divide and rule’ tactics but it’s also about being unapologetic in making the positive case for our United Kingdom. There has literally never been a better time to do so. At the time of writing, almost 800,000 Scots are essentially being paid by the British Government. The union dividend has never been more tangible in the lives of ordinary Scots. That should embolden the likes of Jackson Carlaw and Richard Leonard, but the former is struggling to fill the shoes of the formidable Ruth Davidson and the latter is frankly useless. As a Conservative, I am concerned at this vacuum of leadership. And it’s even more pronounced when we see a UK Government politician as effective as Rishi Sunak calling it out. We should welcome these sound-bites, but recognise that we must re-double our efforts as a pro-UK, anti-nationalist collective and do so\u0026nbsp;now\u0026nbsp;to avert another SNP victory in the Scottish Parliamentary election polls next year.

Of the 73 constituency seats in the Scottish Parliament Elections, 59 are currently held by the SNP. That’s an astonishing 81% of seats from just 46.5% of the vote.\u0026nbsp; Talk about not getting the government you vote for! But how will tactical voting help? First we need to discard the two sets of seats where tactical voting won\u0027t make a difference. The first set is the 28 seats where the combined anti-Nationalist vote is still less than the SNP vote. Even if 100% of the anti-Nationalist vote swung to the second-place candidate, the seat would still remain in the hands of the SNP. In these seats the priority must be to increase the anti-Nationalist vote share. The second set we don\u0027t need to consider are the 15 constituency seats currently held by anti-Nationalist parties. Assuming they will continue to hold them, that leaves 30 seats currently held by the SNP, where there are more anti-Nationalists than SNP voters. These seats are our primary tactical voting targets. See the table above for an interactive table of results. For example, in the first row, Aberdeen Central, the SNP won with 11,648 votes, despite anti-Nationalist parties winning 15,056 votes. The second placed party, Labour, had 7,299 votes, so it would need 4,339 (56.1%) of the remaining 7,759 Conservative and LibDems votes to win the seat. Likewise, in Dunfermline, Labour need to supplement their 9,699 votes with 4,558 votes from 8,953 Conservatives and LibDem votes to win. In this case, around 50.9% would have to switch votes to Labour. If voters vote tactically, anti-Nationalist parties could gain as many as 30 seats. More importantly, the SNP would lose 30 seats. This would result in anti-Nationalists taking 45 out of 73 seats, a majority of eight constituency seats. Labour would gain 14 additional constituency seats, while the Tories would gain 13 seats and the LibDems would gain three seats. Labour and Tories gain almost the same number of seats, so it is fair to say that each party benefits equally. Giving your Labour vote to a Tory candidate in one area, will result in a Labour candidate being elected in another area, and vice versa. This would destroy the SNP for a real generation, not a pretendy one. Even if only 75% of anti-Nationalist voters, whose party didn\u0027t come second to the SNP, switched, there would still be a gain of 17 seats to anti-Nationalist parties, giving a total of 32 constituency seats. More than double. That would still knock the wind out of the SNP\u0027s sails. The main parties must step up While every individual anti-Nationalist voter can do our best to vote tactically and spread the word about tactical voting, it would be far more effective if the main parties created a one-time tactical voting alliance where the parties would field only the best candidate to win in each constituency, while educating their voters on the benefits of tactical voting. The Tories have already said that they are interested in an alliance, but it has been, in our opinion, foolishly rejected by Labour\u0027s leadership candidates. This can be presented to voters as: A one-time deal to break the back of the SNP. One and done.A win-win. Labour and Conservatives gain equally from the deal. If you vote for a Labour/Tory candidate in your area, you will gain a Tory/Labour candidate in another area. More importantly, the SNP will lose those two seats. And any objections can be handled as follows: Are Labour and the Tories working together again?It worked last timeWe are all -- Labour, Conservative and LibDems -- anti-Nationalists against toxic NationalismNationalism is so toxic that it always needs alliances to beat itNationalism, in Scotland, is worse than the Tories. It wasn\u0027t Nationalists who stole Scottish Labour\u0027s votes by pretending to be socialists.It\u0027s a one time dealWhy should voters reward parties that have been, so far, unwilling to consider tactical voting ? Because there is no other way. We need to help the main parties restore themselves.What about once an anti-Nationalist majority wins, should there be a coalition?We believe the main parties should propose 100 days of action, where they agree to work together to put forward centrist plans to improve Scotland\u0027s health, education and economy, but it\u0027s not a requirement of any tactical voting alliance. Voters want success, not lame opposition. If the parties don’t step up and show us they’re worthy of our votes, for good or bad, we will go somewhere else. We have a choice. Another four years of Sturgeon and her endless agitation by a MINORITY, or we give the MAJORITY the tools to break the back of the SNP once and for all. Mark Devlin is the publisher of The Majority.

His lab at Heriot Watt has just unveiled the latest big data computer project that will revolutionise political campaigning. With cutting edge artificial intelligence, The Eye aims to win – and win big. “Remember how Dominic Cummings scribbled for hours to come up with ‘Take Back Control’,” Bowman says. “Now, The Eye can pump out a killer slogan in 0.03 seconds, with 250 other ones to spare.” Rumours abound that the SNP has already signed a contract in preparation for Indy Ref 2. “You might think that, but I couldn’t possibly comment,” Bowman says, blushing about the neck. But he’s not coy about its capabilities. “Once we feed in data about the timing and rules of the referendum, we can generate slogans for any eventuality.” “‘Yes, Scotland’ was pretty effective in 2014,” he admits. “I just love its positive negativity.” The concept seems contradictory, but Bowman stands by it. “It’s crucial to rubbish your opponent by calling them negative – even if calling them negative is just as negative. But no one notices that. It’s genius!” When it comes to a second referendum, Dr Bowman insists The Eye is a game changer. “Absolutely! We can even produce messages for different segments of the electorate.” He turns and types like a tap dancer on tippy-toe. The program has no flashing lights: just a simple output, this time for the Scottish green voter. In less than a nano-second – hey presto – \u0027It’s Scotland’s Soil!\u0027 Bowman smiles with pride. “Pure organic nationalism!”\u0026nbsp; Of course, a key test is whether The Eye can tailor a message to the hard core apathetic voter. The uncommitted punter – bogged down by ‘neverendum’ – is notoriously hard to reach.\u0026nbsp; He hits ‘Enter’ and there it is: ‘Get Scexit Done.’ If you’re surprised at its unoriginality, Bowman is unrepentant: “Never underestimate the power of boredom. People just want it to go away.” But Bowman is still perfecting his search. Like splitting the political atom, The Eye is looking for a killer phrase that will cleave the whole country apart, once and for all.\u0026nbsp; His assistant, Frank, loads up his latest dataset. There’s everything here – from campaign pronouncements to treasury spreadsheets to social media intelligence. Terabytes of input have been trawled from the internet. “The Eye knows more than God does.” It all takes a little longer to process, but the result will distil the Independence campaign to its purest. The two men wait impassively till the data is sifted and digested. Six minutes and twenty-five seconds later, Bowman jolts bolt upright as the result flashes up on screen. The stark message cuts to the core as they blink in disbelief. ‘Make England Foreign Again.’ “It can’t be,” says Frank. “… it just can’t …” Bowman sits stone-faced. “The Eye has seen the truth.” The 3D printer whirrs into action, instantly lasering its slogan upon the Indy campaign hat.\u0026nbsp; And if the cap fits – wear it.","date":"2020-12-19","summary":"The Scexit Files: New Scientist, April 2025 “Nothing escapes The Eye,” grins Dr Dave Bowman.

As Warren Buffett said, \u0027Only when the tide goes out do you discover who\u0027s been swimming naked.\u0027 And in the upcoming election, the electoral tide is going to go so far out against the SNP, it will leave the majority of its MPs metaphorically naked, out in the cold and wondering where their yellow swimsuits went. It’s a far cry from the SNP’s past General Election triumphs. Following the near clean sweep of Scotland\u0027s seats in 2015, there was a temporary correction in 2017 when the SNP lost 21 seats, which is generally attributed to Ruth Davidson, but more correctly attributed to voter disdain for Nicola Sturgeon’s incessant whining about independence. In the snap election of 2019, though, Scottish voters ignored the Boris v Corbyn shootout and returned 48 SNP MPs, thus ensuring a 4th consecutive Conservative Westminster Government, as happens every time Scotland returns a majority of SNP MPs. As we approach the 2024 General Election, the outlook has dimmed considerably for the SNP. Last week, a Norstat poll for the Sunday Times showed the SNP is on track to lose 33 of the seats it won in 2019; virtually all to Labour. What would this mean in terms of well-known SNP faces on the Westminster benches? These are some of the high-profile SNP/Alba MPS who stand to lose their seats: Anum Qaisar in Airdrie \u0026amp; Shotts Steven Bonnar in Coatbridge and Bellshill Neale Hanvey (Alba) in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath Kenny MacAskill (Alba) in East Lothian Angus MacNeil (Independent) in Na h-Eileanan Stewart McDonald in Glasgow South Alison Thewliss in Glasgow North David Linden in Glasgow East Tommy Sheppard in Edinburgh East and Musselburgh Additionally, the following SNP MPs will be stepping down prior to the General Election Stewart Hosie - Dundee East Douglas Chapman - Dunfermline and West Fife Phillippa Whitford - Central Ayrshire Mhairi Black - Paisley and Renfrewshire South Ian Blackford - Ross, Skye \u0026amp; Lochaber Angela Crawley - Lanark and Hamilton East Patrick Grady - Glasgow North Peter Grant - Glenrothes John McNally - Falkirk Lastly, Lisa Cameron, elected as an SNP MP in East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, left the party and joined the Conservatives last year. She now sits in the Commons as a Conservative MP but is almost certain to lose her seat, again to Labour, in the General Election. That\u0027s 19 well-known SNP faces we won\u0027t see any more. In addition, the following SNP MPs are highly vulnerable to removal if voters tactically vote. Jo Cherry in Edinburgh South West Pete Wishart in Perth and Kinross-shire Stephen Flynn in Aberdeen South Chris Law in Dundee Central Patricia Gibson in North Ayrshire and Arran Kirsten Oswald in East Renfrewshire All very gloomy for the SNP. But which of their MPs is least vulnerable? Unfortunately, the following SNP MPs are unlikely to lose their seats: Dave Doogan in Angus and Perthshire Glens Drew Hendry in Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire Brendan O\u0027Hara in Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber Polling, in the UK generally but particularly in Scotland, shows several things: The SNP vote share will undoubtedly fall. The Conservative vote share will fall dramatically from its 2019 peak, when it was inflated by the Corbyn factor that damaged Labour so badly. The Labour vote share will rise as the party takes votes from both the SNP and the Conservatives. The influence of the Lib Dems in Scotland is declining as they are no longer able to attract sufficient votes in the Highlands and Western Isles. The Greens, Alba and Reform will not win seats in Scotland. Add the inevitable fallout from the increasingly rancorous departure of Humza Yousaf from Bute House and, with only six months until the impending election, the SNP looks utterly adrift. New First Minister John Swinney is many things, but not even he would pretend to be an inspirational electoral figure who can reverse polling trends. He\u0027s yesterday\u0027s man, an adoring, loyal deputy at best. \"Everyone needs a Willie\", Margaret Thatcher famously said of her trusty sidekick Willie Whitelaw. Conversely, no-one needs a hapless, bungling no-hoper with an appalling history of misconduct in the chamber and its inquiries. Make no mistake, the desperation with which John Swinney has been shoehorned into Bute House encapsulates the panic felt throughout the party following the disastrous 13 months of Humza\u0027s leadership. The SNP in Westminster will be unrecognisable after this year\u0027s General Election. They are very unlikely to remain the UK\u0027s third largest party, as the Lib Dems will almost certainly reclaim third place.\u0026nbsp; Prospects for the Holyrood party are similarly dire in the Scottish elections, two years after the UK General election. A devastating General Election defeat with no prospect of progress towards the party’s primary goal of independence, combined with 17 years of poor governance, means that the party will be unable to regain momentum. But first, the General Election. The extent to which the SNP\u0027s Westminster representation falls is solely down to voters in constituencies where the combined pro-UK vote share exceeds the SNP. That will necessitate an element of tactical pro-UK voting. And that is another discussion to be held as election day draws closer. David Griffiths is a political analyst.

We are met by the village loudmouth, ostentatiously masked by a black scarf against the Covid on the cold March breeze. “What’s going on here? Did you no see the saltires as you drove in? We don’t want you and your Union here.” He patrols the one street in the village while we are filming, just in case any ‘Yoons’ think about joining in. Despite this several older people do come and quietly give us words of encouragement, “We’ll be voting for you George. Good luck.” Later I speak to a retired police sergeant, who comes up to greet me and meet George. An ex-soldier, like me, with whom I parade at the war memorial each Remembrance Sunday. I have him down as a floating voter and probable Unionist.\u0026nbsp; He and George blether about football. George has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game and had trials for several Scottish clubs in his youth.\u0026nbsp; Then the bombshell: “I’m sorry but I’m going to vote SNP this time. I want independence. I want to do it for my boy here.” George looks astonished. “Seriously? After all the failures and the sleaze and corruption that’s coming out? You still trust them?” “Och they are just as bad in Westminster, what about the corruption down there?” The standard excuse, how depressing. No they really, really aren’t. He then proceeds to tell us, without any doubt or irony, how Scotland subsidises the rest of the UK, something that has apparently been suppressed since Denis Healey took the decision to classify the exact amount back in the 1970s. And, without the dead weight of the rest of the UK, Scotland will definitely have a much brighter future, especially when we get back into Europe, he opines. Our amazed rejoinders about the black and white evidence of the GERS figures showing Scottish reliance of the Barnett Formula fall on deaf ears. He doesn’t buy the near impossibility of getting back into the EU either. As Mark Twain said, “It is easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled.” And there you have the nationalist formula ladies and gentlemen: Intimidation on the streets…The Big Lie Theory, patented in Nazi Germany and still being put to good use by the SNP…sprinkled with ‘whitabootery’ - the Teflon coating that smothers any criticism of the Great Helmswoman.\u0026nbsp; Later that night Unionists on Twitter erupt with Gotcha tweets after David Davis’s hammer blows in the House of Commons. The Ceausescu Moment is surely, surely imminent. The next morning BBC Scotland and STV hardly report it. Our friendly police sergeant will barely have caught it, and, if he did, all he will remember is “Nicola Sturgeon dismissed allegations….” Next up is Ayr. As we cast our words into the salt air of the Irish Sea on the beach front for the benefit of passers-by, and journalists from the Scotsman and Daily Mail, two single vapour trails cross in a clear blue sky behind us in the shape of the Saltire, a happy omen.\u0026nbsp; We appear to be well received by the townsfolk then our security people draw my attention to a large 4x4 across the road. It has two men wearing sunglasses in it and SNP stickers in the windscreen. One of them is talking into a phone, the other stares at us fixedly. “The opposition have turned up. They have been watching us for a while.” Suddenly I am back on patrol in Northern Ireland. There we would frequently be subjected to ‘dicking’ where IRA sympathisers would satellite patrols, reporting our whereabouts to the terrorists. Often it was done overtly and deliberately to intimidate young soldiers.\u0026nbsp; As we disperse the police turn up. They have had an illegal gathering reported to them.

George Galloway, Jamie Blackett, David Griffiths and Alan Sked spoke with clarity and conviction about their formative experiences. An ardent socialist, a conservative-minded businessman, a Leaver and a Remainer, as well as two supporters of Glasgow’s highly competitive football clubs, can be found among the four. What do they have in common beyond a sense of disbelief at the huge harm the SNP has done to Scotland and a wish to move the country out of the dark valley of permanent friction with the rest of Britain? I would venture the opinion that their shared commitment to rescuing the country they love from some of the world’s most disagreeable exponents of identity politics, stems from the different ways they have engaged with the world. A campaigner, a soldier, an educator and a hi-tech entrepreneur have reinforced their characters and intellects by formative experiences beyond Scotland. It has enabled them to place Scotland’s problems in comparative perspective. They can see that the narrative of grudge and grievance tirelessly promoted by the SNP is based on the flimsiest of foundations. In the past few centuries, it is hard to think of another country which has benefited so much from peacefully uniting with a larger neighbour. A parliamentary union voluntarily entered into in 1707, replaced a weak, introspective state with daunting policy failures, with a union allocating Scotland major autonomy and enabling it to develop far more effectively than if it had remained aloof from the rest of the British Isles. Rather than being a check on Scottish capabilities, the union allowed hitherto dormant traits to flourish. Gradually, expanding freedoms, secure property rights, and institutional autonomy provided the basis for an effective partnership. Today, the SNP and its allies in the world of arts and culture, argue that the Union has been a time of humiliation and lost opportunities. Various historical personalities championed by nationalists are bathed in magical aura, from Wallace and Mary Queen of Scots to Prince Charles Edward Stuart. It is never explained how the people living in Scotland when they were alive would have benefited in practical terms if they had succeeded politically. Their plans were bound up with their own personal ambitions and frustrations. This is true of their successors Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. They have shown the same flair for messy personal feuds and vendettas which characterised the Anglo-Norman barons in the era of Wallace and Robert the Bruce. Local parliamentarians in the North-West Highlands, Ian Blackford and Maree Blackford, instead of showing respect for the British Prime Minister holidaying in their midst, have instead, reacted with glee when a local supporter in Applecross, allowed himself to be used in a cheap stunt which obliged Johnson to cut short his holiday this week. A compliant media usually plays down the intimidation which members of the SNP can at times use against those who stand in their way. It has preferred to sprinkle stardust, first on Salmond and then on Sturgeon, because they stood for risk, excitement and novelty. A changing popular culture, not just in Scotland but across much of the West, has thrust previously fringe movements into power because they offer emotional fulfillment to people who, more often than not, don’t have much happening in their lives. But, for three-quarters of its existence, the SNP’s appeal to the Scots to live dangerously and allow it to lead them on some mysterious political excursion towards a fabled independence, fell flat. Most Scots were not impressed by having dimly-recalled medieval personalities as contemporary heroes. Their level of education was at that time a high one. They failed to see how the SNP\u0027s heroes rated above the inventors, engineers, medics, scientists, educators, explorers and even quite a few of the Scots who had made their mark in politics, the bureaucracy and the military. For several centuries, far more Scots than now were used to going out into the world. Their energy intellect, ingenuity, their aggression veering into cruelty at times, but also their idealism and dedication to improvement in the lands where they settled, made a big difference to the world. Nationalist politicians and media allies make much of Scottish freebooters who helped instigate the Opium war against China which gave Britain a 150-year lease over Hong Kong. But, they forget the great development of the territory under British rule and how it became a magnet for a unique Chinese democratic civilization. Jamie Blackett served as a soldier in Hong Kong and he referred in his broadcast to the role of the Scottish economist Sir John Copperthwaite in making the colony one of the most go-ahead places on the planet. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher failed to hold out for terms that would have reinforced the ability of Hong Kong to remain free, even as a new relationship was forged with communist China after the 150 year colonial lease expired. More recently, London displayed its naivety when David Cameron granted the SNP an independence referendum on terms that massively reinforced the advantage of the SNP. 16-year-olds were able to vote but, the three-quarter million Scots living elsewhere in Britain, were denied a vote, as were Scottish soldiers serving outside Scotland. The SNP got the civil service to draw up a White Paper on Independence which made fanciful claims about how cheap, smooth and unruffled a transition to independence would be. Oil revenues would ensure a continuity of essential public services. Scotland’s induction into the EU would be swift and effortless. The claims in the White Paper have been quietly ditched by the SNP. But its insistence that independence is essential however daunting the economic challenges, has grown even stronger. Support for the party has also grown in this year of the Covid pandemic. The British government’s generous furlough scheme, far from proving the value of the Union, has been brushed aside by a confrontational Sturgeon and a largely subservient local media. The conditions which incubated the growth of the SNP – the rise of a parochial, self-referential, and introspective Scotland – have intensified during the months of lockdown when the only politician to appear day after day has been Nicola Sturgeon. Information has been elusive in her daily media briefings about her administration’s exact role in combating the pandemic. But these presidential-style outings have been a heaven-sent opportunity for a clever populist to influence hearts and minds with regular attacks directed at London and barely concealed encouragement to militant supporters to discourage English visitors from coming to Scotland. If Sturgeon seeks to take advantage of a looming difficult decade to remove Scotland from the United Kingdom, it is likely not much will be heard thereafter of the EU. Brussels will most certainly not replicate the fiscal transfer of £2,000 per head which Scotland receives from the rest of Britain, over £10bn annually. Scotland will not go from being an integrated part of a single monetary and fiscal British entity to being part of the EU, because the sheer size of the Scottish deficit means it falls far short of entry requirements. How would a post-UK Scottish state facing an annual budget deficit of £13 billion, seek to keep services afloat at least to a minimum degree? The likelihood is that it would gravitate towards unlovely regimes ready to prop up a rickety economy in return for political services. This is not science fiction. Under both the SNP’s First Ministers, the devolved regime has assiduously courted Middle Eastern as well as East Asian regimes whose track records on human rights are deplorable. In 1994, it was likely that very few inhabitants of newly-independent Belarus imagined they would be embarking on a 26-year-long dictatorship when they elected a rather thuggish state and party bureaucrat, Alexander Lukashenko, as President. But that is what happened. Belarus has endured a limited form of independence courtesy of much stronger Russia. It is not inconceivable that Scotland, finding itself an economic basket case and with even less natural resources than Belarus, would enter into a new dependency relationship which would make the British link a shattered golden dream. Scots who could, would leave in massive numbers. There is already a brain drain and a flight of high earners. The exodus of far larger numbers, many of them young supporters of the SNP, would inevitably follow an unplanned exit from the UK and a crash in fortunes that would likely be as severe as what was seen in many parts of the Soviet Union following its break up. What is the sense of a country beating itself up in such a foolish manner. Scotland is now a land of grievances. But they are virtual grievances stoked up by the clever propaganda machine of a governing party. Perhaps most people in multinational states would envy the good terms which Scots enjoy within the devolved United Kingdom. The Alliance for Unity has worldy-wise Scots, whose experiences far and near, have woken them up to the dangers their country faces if the hold over emotions of a dominant campaigning platform, leads to separation. George Galloway and Jamie Blackett are building up a political movement which aims to persuade Scots to stop and think. It is folly to allow blood and soil to override common sense. Their goal of uniting the anti-separatist majority and peacefully removing the SNP from office next May is not utopian, but what a situation full of menace calls for. Let’s hope 2021 ushers in a revolution in common sense and Scotland once again will be known to the world for its practicality and not its small-minded and foolish political posturing.

It is a post-national movement that defines itself by creating enemies and enmities. It tears through Scottish society, because it sees Scotland very differently from the rest of us. It is an ugly, frightening imagination of our country that is created through collective narcissism.\u0026nbsp; Narcissism is the inability to distinguish self from an internalised ideal. It is pathological, unhealthy and dangerous. You could describe it as an eggshell personality, that rapidly fractures under pressure of criticism. So how do these poor narcissistic souls manage their lives?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; They project a sense of unmoderated esteem, or hubris. They are haughty, cocky, dismissive and diminutive. Without moderation, they are devoid of humility. Note several traits you always see in narcissists: 1. Intolerance of criticism. They cannot reconcile it with their self worth so they find it extremely painful and will always deflect, gaslight, and shift blame. 2. Absence of humour. Humour requires humility their inflated self-esteem cannot contemplate. 3. Desire to be adored, and to adore. A deep desire to seek adulation leads both to Sturgeon\u0027s Madonna/Chief Mammy complex and those who uncritically fawn over her. 4. Rage. The more accurate the attacks, the more vitriolic and toxic the fight back. The only response is to attempt to annihilate the opponent through ridicule, cancelling, social media battery, or whatever knife comes to hand.\u0026nbsp; 5. Lying. Narcissists accept no personal responsibility, so they lie glibly to artificially inflate their self-worth. Narcissists use these devices to avoid psychological pain. Every action, every word must either make them look good, or deflect from them looking bad.\u0026nbsp; So far I could have described a great many politicians, but the Nationalists’ narcissism is a much more dangerous beast, because it is collective. Its malice never gets tired and cannot be reasoned with. Nationalist’s collective narcissism takes the form of what I call \"MyScotland\", a fantasy projection of the future and a rejection of the failures of the past.\u0026nbsp; MyScotland exists in the eternal now. It has always been, and will be, what they wish it to be. From the 14th century Declaration of Arbroath, through Braveheart, it exists as a noble fantasy unsullied by reality, logic or history.\u0026nbsp; MyScotland rejects inconvenient democracy. MyScotland has not left the European Union. It rejects both the Brexit and 2014 referendums. In MyScotland, 45% is the majority. In fact the 45% is the entirety of MyScotland, and anything outside that is cast aside, worthless. MyScotland says it doesn’t have a voice in Westminster, while Nationalist MPs never shut up, even when they have nothing to say. They hate that MyScotland is not tolerated in Westminster, where representation is real. Some Unionists say that the UK should federalise, but to formally fuse Scotland with MyScotland is the most dangerous and self defeating of fallacies.\u0026nbsp; So too is thinking that MyScotland can be bargained with, that with some new powers or new responsibilities, it will become responsible. MyScotland is not a reasonable animal. The more you treat MyScotland as a problem to handle, the more attention and esteem you feed it. MyScotland embodies the Scottish Cringe, unable to face itself in the mirror, it projects its fears and inadequacies outwards. The need for control, the intolerance to criticism, the malice towards opponents, the inability of ever, ever doing the job at hand.\u0026nbsp; But, always remember, MyScotland is not real, and those who believe in it don’t believe in the real Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Once we realise narcissists cannot distinguish themselves from their faults, it is possible to shatter their MyScotland myth through something remarkably simple: highlighting the contrast between the real, living and breathing Scotland and their static fantasy of MyScotland. We can defeat them by showing voters we are better than them, at everything. We need to present a far better offer to Nationalist voters than we have so far.\u0026nbsp; Continuously attack their record, here in reality. The rolling barrage has to be endless. Every scandal is an opportunity to tear into their record, but we MUST propose better real-world solutions.\u0026nbsp; This will splinter their narcissistic psyche, their fantasies will wither, and the real Scotland, the one that we believe in, will thrive.

A young child comes into view, the first of many, their gleaming eyes open and eager. They start talking in the coached manner of totalitarian regimes: The children of North Korea would like to say ‘thank you’ to our Dear Leader. We are so grateful, thank you for always keeping us safe, working so hard, for being strong for us. Thank you for caring for every individual life and for always thinking about the children. Thank you, Dear Leader, thank you, thank you, thank you…. But this isn’t North Korea’s state run propaganda channel. This was, with the change of the country and its leader’s name, Scottish children, coached by their teacher to praise Nicola Sturgeon and broadcast on STV’s Twitter account. Scottish nationalism insists that Scotland would be better off outside the UK, when all reputable economists can tell you that that would certainly not be the case. To distract from this harsh reality, Scottish Nationalist leaders have had to instil in their followers beliefs that transcend reason, into the realms of faith. Is Scottish Nationalism a faith? In August 2018, Christopher McEleny, an SNP councillor in Inverclyde, was granted the right to sue The Ministry of Defence because, he claimed, his security clearance had been revoked because of his nationalist views. Ruling on the case, Judge Frances Eccles, said that support for Scottish independence is indeed a philosophical belief akin to a religion.\u0026nbsp; (Although a ‘philosophical belief’ does sound like a contradiction in terms: philosophers engage in rational thought, but a ‘belief’ is not rational thought.) Certainly, any discussion, online or off, will reveal Scottish nationalists behaving as if they are members of a religious cult: the words ‘belief’, ‘faith’, ‘hope’ figure frequently. Some even say that they ‘believe in Scotland’, and accuse their adversaries of not ‘believing in Scotland’, as if ‘Scotland’ were some sort of deity to be worshipped.\u0026nbsp; In 2014, the Nationalists even had their own holy scripture, The White Paper. Now that even nationalists admit that it was, er, fanciful, there is no substitute. Yet holy writ descends daily from SNP headquarters in the form of propaganda distorting or denying truths, and the party faithful obediently reproduce it without, apparently, having given its meaning any thought. Many engage in leader-worship verging on idolatry.\u0026nbsp; Nicola Sturgeon is an unlikely Messiah, but a host of image-makers and PR gurus have been hard at work burnishing her image since 2014, and the faithful have dutifully fallen into line. From her acclamation as leader, after the failed referendum, when she stilled the riotous cheers with arms raised in a messianic pose, to her now unchallenged leadership – ‘I decide’. She is their High Priestess, leading daily prayers for the faithful: Scotland is destined for glorious success. If only Westminster/London/the UK/the Tories/the English weren’t holding us back, we could achieve our God-given potential. She could take us to a Scotland that is heaven on Earth. Cast aside those within her own party who express doubts about the failure to press on to another referendum and about the treatment of Salmond, that latter day Lazarus. They are but minor heretics. With an imperious gesture of dismissal, Ms Sturgeon can wave away any questions. About the Coronavirus: she had heard that England’s care home deaths (proportionately fewer than in Scotland) were ‘underreported’, or, when virus expert Professor Hugh Pennington commented on the infective level of care homes, she muttered ‘I don’t know where he got that figure’. If she doesn’t know, then the subject is of no account. Her pronouncements, unchallenged by a compliant media, are treated as gospel truth.\u0026nbsp; And her followers lap it up. A young man posted a picture of himself with his life-size cardboard cut-out of Ms Sturgeon. ‘Robert’, only a few days ago, tweeted: Ma heart feels aw warm and fuzzy whenever Nicola Sturgeon is on the telly while another tweeted a picture of Sturgeon with a halo and the words\u0026nbsp; This woman is so beautiful and pure I just want to cry Then there was the woman who tweeted her gratitude:\u0026nbsp; When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Sturgeon comes to me, speaking words of wisdom, SNP, SNP. This is idolatry on a grand scale and certainly justifies the use of the word ‘cult’. I have only one question: whatever happened to the ‘canny Scot’? Help us fight back In less than a year there\u0027s going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nationalists will use it to sow further division and continue to agitate for a disastrous referendum.

Lies and chicanery are their customary modus operandi. One of the most recent comes from Chris Law, an SNP MP for Dundee, who has tweeted: ‘The Barnett Formula Myth Destroyed – it does not subsidise Scotland’.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/ChrisLawSNP/status/1347319507803648001 He bases this on a blog post by Gordon Macintyre-Kemp, leader of ‘Business for Scotland’, the sham business organisation which is nothing more than an SNP propaganda front. It raises the question, yet again: if a separate Scotland would be so wonderful, why do Nationalists have to tell such blatant lies about it?\u0026nbsp; An entire industry of nationalist memes, promoting blatant lies, has invaded the online sphere, with enthusiastic graphic artists, as well as those who can simply use a camera and editing facilities, deploying their skills in the service of their dishonest cause. They ply their trade by falsifying or cropping quotations to mean something other than what the speaker or writer was actually saying, or by simply telling lies. Three of these methods come easily to mind.\u0026nbsp; #1 Cropped Tweets We start with a meme attributed to Ruth Davidson, Conservative leader in the Scottish parliament, during the Scottish referendum campaign. This is accurate… as far as it goes. Ms Davidson was pointing out the indisputable truth, that voting yes for Scottish separation in 2014 meant leaving the EU.\u0026nbsp; The EU Commission had already written twice to the Scottish parliament to affirm that, if Scotland left the UK, an EU member state, it would, at the same time, in March 2016, leave the EU. There was no mention of any deal being proposed between the EU and secessionist Scotland. The meme states ‘No means we stay in, we are a member of the European Union’. That is, the UK remains a member of the EU. As baldly as that. But Ms Davidson’s quotation has not been given in full, thus changing its meaning. The true quotation is not so very different – except that Ms Davidson had included a crucial addition that is missing from the nationalist propaganda …and yes if the Conservatives win the next election… we will allow people to have their say (in a European referendum).\u0026nbsp; The possibility of a referendum on EU membership was in 2014 a known unknown, as Donald Rumsfeld, President GW Bush’s secretary of defence, used to say. It was even mentioned in the SNP’s 2013 White Paper, as a bogeyman to frighten people into voting for separation – not that Scotland leaving the UK would have kept it in the EU. David Cameron could not have been clearer, when he announced, in his Bloomberg speech on 23 January 2013, that, early in the 2015 parliament: We will give the British people a referendum with a very simple in-or-out choice: to stay in the European Union on these new terms, or to come out altogether.\u0026nbsp; In similar vein, the businessman and blogger Kevin Hague has had a meme extracted from his blog cropped and therefore falsified. It relates to the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) figures, which nationalists are determined to disparage and delegitimise. Hague - who is a bête-noir of Scottish nationalists because he has destroyed any economic case they thought they had - is shown saying: GERS can’t tell us what an independent Scotland would look like.\u0026nbsp; This has been seized on by Nationalists, claiming that it undermines Hague’s anti-separatist stance and careful analysis. This quotation is, however, extracted from a much longer piece, in which Hague says, among other things: The GERS figures provide the foundations on top of which any credible economic case for independence must be built. To those who claim ‘we wouldn’t start from here’, the question is ‘where would you start from?’.\u0026nbsp; Where else is there to start from but where we are? As Hague says:\u0026nbsp; To suggest that how our fiscal balance would look based on the taxes we’re used to raising and the public spending we’re used to receiving tells us ‘nothing’, ‘almost nothing’ or only ‘relatively little’ about an independent Scotland’s potential finances is frankly insulting to the intelligence of the reader. The figures tell us a great deal about where we start from and the scale of the challenge we’d face. Cropping Hague’s blog in this way was a deliberate falsification of his argument and is an indication of how feared he is by nationalists. It is also an indication of how determined nationalists are to discredit the GERS, which is accepted as authoritative by any reputable economist. #2 Doctored memes This is where what has been said is deliberately distorted to support a dishonest Nationalist claim. In 2019, Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, made his annual Mansion House speech, in which he said: I cannot imagine a Conservative and Unionist-led government actually pursuing a no-deal Brexit, willing to risk the Union and our economic prosperity.\u0026nbsp; He warned that a no-deal Brexit could pull the United Kingdom apart and would deprive Britain’s next leader of the money needed to end austerity. This was converted into a nationalist meme by the usual suspects to read that Scotland leaving the union would deprive Britain’s next leader of the money to end austerity. The scam that Hammond was saying that the rest of the UK would be seriously disadvantaged without Scotland’s financial contribution, is outright dishonesty, distorting and misquoting what Hammond actually said for nationalist propaganda purposes.\u0026nbsp; #3 Downright lies Then there are simple lies, such as Scotland paying for HS2 or Crossrail. It doesn\u0027t. The common Nationalist assertion that Scotland raises much more in tax that it gets to spend is often quoted in memes and was endorsed by SNP cabinet secretary Mike Russell. However, Russell\u0027s claims were shown by the Ferret Fact Service to be FALSE\u0026nbsp; The true figures, from GERS, are below: But the truth never matters to the Nationalist meme-maker, who simply moves the goalposts: As a bonus point for those who disparage the GERS, here is the former First Minister’s view of GERS.\u0026nbsp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSvocvvj7rg #4 Irrelevant nonsense Finally, there are memes like this that feed on Scottish exceptionalism as an attempt to show that Scotland is richer than it actually is. I\u0027ll leave it to those who have more time on their hands to go through line by line, but its claims have little relevance to the actual economy, Scotland\u0027s negative balance of payments, nor the £13 billion annual deficit that Scotland incurs. These are but a small sample of the dishonest propaganda conveyed by nationalist memes to the faithful and to those whom they seek to win over to their cause. It needs to be stressed that the dishonesty involved in creating them is entirely deliberate. I see little reason to doubt that this deliberate dishonesty is encouraged by Peter Murrell’s SNP HQ. It is certainly not disowned by that office.\u0026nbsp; Nationalists believe so fervently in their cause that, for them, the end really does justify the means. If achieving secession requires falsehoods and distortion of the truth, then so be it. But that leaves the question with which I started. If leaving the UK is such an attractive proposition, why can nationalists not tell the truth about its ramifications?\u0026nbsp; Jill Stephenson is former professor of modern German history at the University of Edinburgh.

This theory was the basis of US and other countries’ foreign policy and helped fuel armed conflicts in the post-1945 period.\u0026nbsp; While Communism was stopped by a combination of external resistance and internal collapse, The Domino Effect provides a good analogy for the current Balkanization of the UK that has occurred as a result of the introduction of legislative devolution. Legislative devolution in one part of the UK (SNP dominated devolved Scotland mostly) has enabled anti-UK nationalists (the SNP primarily) to rise to power, ignore reserved limitations on their remit and use their devolved executive to pursue independence/reunification referenda. This has encouraged nationalists in other devolved parts of the UK (Wales and Northern Ireland) and even England itself, to pursue independence/re-unification and devolution with greatly enhanced ability as well as much more aggressively when they wouldn’t have been in a position to do so without this encouragement in a kind of knock-on effect, just like the metaphorical dominoes. It is now manifestly true that this has been the case throughout the entire UK. Take Wales, for instance. The Welsh nationalists, Plaid Cymru, have existed since 1925 (nine years before the formation of the SNP) but in their early years had been more of a cultural nationalist movement, trying to promote the Welsh language and culture. They had desired independence from the UK, but this was very much a longer-term objective. After the introduction of legislative devolution in the late 1990s and influenced by the SNP’s aggressive campaign for independence, this stance began to change and Plaid began to adopt a much more militantly pro-independence agenda.\u0026nbsp; The domino effect began to come into play, as Plaid pushed for new referenda on granting the then Welsh Assembly (now ‘parliament’) more and more powers, including one in 2011 that substantially increased the areas of its legislative competency. Emboldened by the successful attempts of the SNP to hold an independence referendum, Plaid jumped on the bandwagon and has intimated a few times now that they would push for an independence referendum in Wales if they felt the conditions were right (i.e. that they would win).\u0026nbsp; In an ominous echo of the 2007 re-naming of the Scottish Executive to the Scottish Government by the SNP (though Labour had also backed this move as well), the Welsh Assembly announced in 2017 that it now wished to be known as the ‘Welsh parliament’, a further step in the direction of Wales distancing itself constitutionally from the rest of the UK. Added to all this, Plaid have recently intimated that they will agitate for an independence referendum if there is another one in Scotland. Mark Drakeford, the Labour First Minister in the Welsh ‘parliament’, attempted to court Plaid by stating that he would grant them a referendum on independence if Labour was re-elected in the 2021 Welsh ‘parliament’ elections AND would allow Adam Price, the Plaid leader, to be First Minister.\u0026nbsp; All of this resurgence of aggressive anti-UK nationalism has only come about as a knock on effect of the SNP’s machinations in Scotland. Events would not have developed in this direction if legislative devolution hadn’t been introduced into Scotland. A similar, though markedly more pronounced, effect is in evidence in Northern Ireland. The introduction of legislative devolution there has witnessed a rising tide of anti-UK nationalist sentiment and an increase in calls for re-unification with Eire. As with Wales, these clarion calls for re-unification have been magnified by the megaphone of devolution, which has brought the topic very much into the forefront of the public’s eye, something that just wouldn’t have been anywhere so acute without devolution.\u0026nbsp; Nationalist and even some ‘mainstream’ politicians in England have been affected by these phenomena as well. Even though the idea of English regional assemblies was conclusively defeated in a referendum held in North-East England on 4th November 2004 by a margin of 77.9% to 22.1%, the knock-on effect of legislative devolution in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland has led to a resurgence in the concept of English regional government. This idea was resurrected in 2012 when certain Northern English MPs wrote a letter to The Observer newspaper, openly stating that it was time to reconsider having Northern regional assemblies (in England). They were clearly inspired by Scottish devolution. Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman wrote:\u0026nbsp; The North has a much larger population than Scotland … We don’t have a body to deal with strategic problems and issues for the North .\u0026nbsp; The public in the North started to have concerns that devolution had left the northern regions of England as the poor relations of Scotland in terms of economic and political clout. These concerns were magnified even more when Holyrood gained even more powers in 2016 and would be further exacerbated if (or it would be more correct to say ‘when’) more powers are added in the future.\u0026nbsp; The continual granting of new powers to the Welsh Assembly/ ‘parliament’ has, and will, continue to have the same effect on England. What’s more, 2021 saw a further unsettling development, with the formation of a political party dedicated to the political independence of the North of England from the rest of the UK. Yorkshire also now has a political party that demands separation from the rest of the UK. The Balkanization of the UK, initiated and accelerated by the introduction of legislative devolution, continues to accelerate.\u0026nbsp; The extreme South-West of England is another domino that has been placed in the chain. The Duchy of Cornwall has, for a long time, had a history of a small minority of residents asserting that they have a separate cultural identity from the rest of England. They had a different language and certain elements considered themselves to be of different ethnic origin. However, Cornish became a dead language by the end of the Nineteenth Century, having essentially ceased to be used by the vast majority of the population and the concept of a separate Cornish identity as a political issue declined and fell into abeyance as a result. Despite Mebyon Kernow, (‘The sons of Cornwall’), a political party that pushed for Cornish autonomy (i.e., a Cornish assembly), being formed in 1951, it was the introduction of legislative devolution in the late 1990s that really sparked interest in devolution in Cornwall.\u0026nbsp; The Cornish Constitutional Convention launched a campaign for a devolved Cornish legislature on the back of the referenda in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland that led to the setting up of devolved institutions in these parts of the UK. In October 2007, Andrew George, a Liberal Democrat MP said: \u0026nbsp;If Scotland is benefitting from devolution, then Cornwall should learn from this and increase the intensity of its campaign for devolution to a Cornish Assembly. In 2009, Liberal Democrat MP William Rogerson presented a ‘Government of Cornwall’ Bill before the House of Commons, which argued for a devolved Cornish assembly that was very similar in set up to the Scots and Welsh legislatures. The Domino Effect influence of Scots, Welsh, and Northern Ireland devolution is clear from the following statement made by Rogerson:\u0026nbsp; Cornwall is entitled to a level of self-government. If the Government is going to recognize the right of Scotland and Wales to greater self-determination because of their unique cultural and political positions, then they should recognize ours.\u0026nbsp; But that’s not all. Not content with (trying) to break up the United Kingdom, the SNP are now imperilling the very existence of Scotland as a unitary political entity. Recent developments have shown that the actions of the SNP are setting up dominoes within Scotland itself. In 2020, Shetland voted to explore ways to become independent of Scotland. The Shetland Islands Council overwhelmingly voted to start looking at ways to become financially and politically independent of Scotland. Councillors voted 18 to 2 in favour of a motion to formally explore options ‘for achieving financial and political self-determination’. In a debate lasting more than an hour, members argued that decision-making has become increasingly centralised and public funding for the island has been cut under the SNP dominated Holyrood administration.\u0026nbsp; Councillor Steven Coutts said that devolution has not benefited the area and added that the Scottish parliament feels ‘remote’ to islanders, who face some of the highest rates of fuel poverty in the country. The status quo is not working. Devolution and the Islands Act have not made any tangible difference to the quality of life.\u0026nbsp; In further developments, the Orkney Islands council leader James Stockan has asserted that they might become part of Norway but be self-governed due to the failings of SNP-dominated Holyrood in Scotland. Council leader Mr Stockan blamed a lack of funding coming from Holyrood as the reason behind these shock plans. He said that the islands were being ‘failed dreadfully’ by the SNP. With both Shetland and the Orkney Islands exploring options for independence from Scotland, Scotland would be cut off from the vast majority of its oil supplies, further undermining the SNP’s case for independence.\u0026nbsp; Other regions of Scotland (the Borders, Clydesdale, Tweeddale; Berwickshire, Roxburgh, Selkirk; Dumfries and Galloway) have expressed similar sentiments and the reason for it is invariably unhappiness at the way the SNP is mismanaging their affairs. The SNP and their misdeeds have had a knock on effect on Scotland itself similar to that they’ve had on the UK generally and England specifically. The SNP and devolution has encouraged a previously unitary, cohesive country (the UK) and a part of that country (England) to fragment into several separate entities. It’s extremely ironic that it’s the SNP’s own actions that have led to this Domino Effect in Scotland itself.\u0026nbsp; The UK Government must take some blame for not enforcing the remit system set up by the devolution ‘settlement’ in which the devolved legislatures (Holyrood, the Welsh ‘parliament’ and Stormont) can only debate and pass legislation on matters that aren’t reserved for Westminster’s consideration. Why does it allow the anti–UK nationalists to abuse the remit system to such a monumental degree? It’s totally irrelevant that independence is the raison d’être of the SNP (and Plaid, or that re-unification is also IRA/Sinn Fein and the SDLP’s). They simply have no business getting involved in reserved matters.\u0026nbsp; The then Labour government did nothing to stop Alex Salmond changing the title of Holyrood from the ‘Scottish Executive’ to the ‘Scottish Government’, even though it was extremely obvious that this was a deliberate attempt to subvert the concept of devolution and move Holyrood towards a perceived equal status as a national government on a par with Westminster. Added to this, the Welsh Assembly changing its title to ‘parliament’ is something that the UK Government does not appear to have wanted to stop.\u0026nbsp; All in all, there has been an apparent and palpable lack of interest and vigour from Westminster for defending the UK against the increasing encroachments by anti-UK nationalism on UK sovereignty and their pretentions to being national governments, rather than just devolved administrations. Their appeasement has led to a clearly discernible pattern of legislative devolution in one part of the UK, i.e., Scotland, having a knock on effect on other parts in a domino-like effect. The SNP in Scotland set the ball rolling by aggressively ignoring their devolved remit, and this clearly encouraged other devolved regions like Wales and Northern Ireland to follow suit and become more confident and so more bellicose in their demands for ever greater autonomy and even to push for full independence. This disunity is spreading across the UK and even Scotland, in an uncontrollable wave of copycat aggressive nationalism that threatens to throw the British Isles back to the early 10th century days of being a disunited, warring hodgepodge of fiefdoms and kingdoms. It’s time the UK government stepped in to ensure the integrity of the UK and stopped the dominoes from falling.

I had never really thought much about the Green Party. While serving around the world in the Army, I had formed a hazy impression of them as well-meaning eco-eccentrics, the recipients of the none-of-the-above vote at elections and recently led by Caroline Lucas, who seemed to punch above her weight, and occasionally say something sensible on Question Time.\u0026nbsp; It was only when I moved back to Scotland that I realised that the Scottish Greens were something entirely different, and only very tenuously connected to their English counterparts. In fact, it took an old friend of mine who has stood with repeated, and so far unfulfilled, optimism as a Green Party candidate in the South of England to explain the difference.\u0026nbsp; “You see”, he said, “You and I are Limes. We care passionately about conserving the environment and we are green on the outside and green all the way through. That lot in Scotland are Watermelons, green on the skin and red to the core.”\u0026nbsp; That definition helps to understand everything about ‘the SNP’s gardening section’ as we in the Alliance4Unity like to call them. Somewhere along the line, probably after the collapse of the Soviet Union made Marxism go out of fashion, extreme Leftists realised that pushing the doctrine of Marx and his foxhunting friend Engels was not going to get them anywhere. Instead they rediscovered the theories of the inciter of the French Revolution a century earlier, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. This opened up an agenda that contained a heady mixture of land reform and romantic back-to-nature ideas of returning Scotland to its pre-agrarian state. It is a deeply misanthropic philosophy. The Greens would like to see shepherds driven off the hills along with their sheep and replaced with forests, replete with wolves. The SNP and the Greens became natural bedfellows as the SNP are also misanthropic, unless you are a racially pure Scot and support \u0027independence\u0027, that is. The Greens, for opportunistic reasons, also supported separatism and the SNP were delighted about this as they were both then able to game the electoral system, with the SNP focusing on the constituency seats and the Greens winning seats off the List in an unofficial separatist alliance. Then lo, in 2016, the Scottish Greens found themselves kingmakers and in coalition with the minority SNP government. Since then, The Gardening Section has greedily extracted concessions from the SNP in return for supporting their legislation, and in doing so has forced it to give up any pretence of being ‘Tartan Tories’, with the notable exception of Fergus Ewing, who looks increasingly out of place. And just as the SNP has ‘natified’ the civil service, the gardeners have converted the RSPB to an increasingly anti-farmer stance.\u0026nbsp; During all this time, Scotland’s countryside has suffered. Farmers have faced financial difficulties as the food processors’ and retailers’ power has been concentrated in the hands of quasi-monopolists. Wild salmon have disappeared from our rivers, while poorly regulated salmon farms have spread disease.\u0026nbsp;The red squirrel has become extinct across much of Scotland as the pox-bearing grey squirrel has spread. Wading birds, like the curlew, have also declined rapidly, as the heather moorland where they breed has been covered in trees, and badgers and other predators have proliferated unchecked.\u0026nbsp; Deer have been systematically massacred and left to rot on the hill to make way for yet more trees. Yet The Gardening Section has turned a blind eye to these problems, and instead, pursued a narrow vendetta against grouse shooting, seemingly purely to perpetuate the class war. The countryside is currently braced to see what red meat the SNP is preparing to throw the Greens to help them get Humza Yousaf’s hated Hate Crimes Bill through Parliament.\u0026nbsp; As a farmer, I have watched with deepening gloom as this unholy separatist alliance has ridden roughshod over rural interests, ignoring the advice given to them by organisations like the Scottish Gamekeepers’ Association.

But, as committed as we are to destroying nationalist delusions, we must also assess anti-nationalist delusions as well, of which the main one is that the only strategy to beat the SNP is a Labour-Tory alliance. Not only is an alliance not going to happen, Labour’s strategy of not forming an alliance with the Scottish Tories is correct. This also means that recent attacks on Tories by Labour are also correct. Way Back in 2021 The Majority was formed because there was, and still is, widespread frustration in Scotland, that the anti-nationalist majority is under the thumb of a nationalist minority. Surely, if the anti-nationalist majority would only work together, we could beat toxic nationalists? There was a possibility last year, if Labour had grasped the nettle, that an electoral pact to break this situation could have happened. In that case, Tories and Labour would have stood down candidates in constituencies where they split the vote. According to our calculations at the time, if they had done this in just 15 constituencies, they would have regained power.\u0026nbsp; As the victors, they could then have opened the books and created all kinds of mayhem for the SNP. And who cares if the SNP, the opponents you’ve beaten, keep calling you ‘Red Tories’? Surely winning is its own reward? To try to force the issue, a single-purpose party, All For Unity (A4U), was formed to pressure the main parties to work together. Many tactical voting guides were created and, to some extent, it worked. The retention of Jackie Ballie’s seat through individual tactical voting, denied the SNP their majority. But numerical logic isn\u0027t political logic. As much as we pushed for this strategy, it wasn’t the only path forward. Labour party leadership assessed that the cost of working with the Tories was too great, even to win that way. Why? The Art of War The disappointment regarding an alliance not happening is based on the feeling that we need a solution right now. It’s a form of defeatism: the feeling that the SNP are so strong that we must do something, anything, to beat them. But we have time. It’s a long way to the next elections.\u0026nbsp; Labour is playing that longer game. There are two elections coming up that are actually important. The next General Election and the Scottish elections in 2026.\u0026nbsp; The SNP have no momentum and, with no hope of a second referendum, they will eventually, through all of our efforts, reach a tipping point, when their support realises they’ve been taken for mugs. Where will those disillusioned voters go then?\u0026nbsp; Every day, on social media, we see nationalists asking why the SNP isn’t giving them the referendum they so desperately hope for (Spoiler alert: because they can’t — there is no path to a second referendum). And when they start to realise there is no path forward, they start looking around at the wreckage around them, and think, maybe, just maybe, they’ve been led down the wrong path. But where do they go next? What Becomes of the Brokenhearted? The SNP’s entire reason for its existence is to propose a new country, free of Tories. But after losing the 2014 referendum, and with no prospect of a second one, the party has nowhere to go. Voting for the SNP is a wasted vote: They cannot get rid of the Tories by making a separate country, and they can’t get rid of the Tories at Westminster, because they only stand candidates in 59 out of 650 seats. Every day, we see Nationalists complaining about the Tories. The recent SNP party political broadcast didn’t mention a single SNP achievement and simply asked how far you could ‘trust a Tory’.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1511032230012928006 But if you really don’t like the Tories, if you really hate Boris, if you really think he’s a criminal, and if you really think he should be put out of office, why would you support a party that can\u0027t get independence to get away from them? Why would you support a party that can’t form a government to get him out? A Bridge of Gold Aside from the idea that Labour should work with the Tories in Scotland — an idea that, if we’re honest, is led by Scottish conservatives — the reality is that Labour is an anti-Tory party. Scottish conservatives can’t see that Labour voters don’t think the SNP is their biggest enemy; they think the Tories are their biggest enemy. The question for any anti-Tory voter is; out of all the Tory opposition, who can actually beat them? For disillusioned SNP voters to return, Labour has to show that they are a more effective anti-Tory party than the SNP. It can\u0027t attract votes from ex-SNP or from young socialist-minded people if they are seen to be working with the Tories.\u0026nbsp; In the Art of War, Sun-Tzu said: Build your enemy a Golden Bridge to retreat\u0026nbsp;across Labour has to build a Golden Bridge, paved with anti-Tory messages, so that ex-SNP voters can come back. Labour’s message is simple: You tried that: it didn’t work. Now, we are the only party that can get rid of the Tories. That is why it can’t countenance any alliance with the Tories, and that means they must attack them. It\u0027s Already Happening Will voters return to the SNP? Not right away. They have to go through the five stages of grief: denial (we’re getting our referendum, aren’t we?), anger (Why can’t Sturgeon deliver a referendum?), bargaining (I can be a socialist and a nationalist, right?), depression (I’ve been taken for a mug) and acceptance (that Anas Sarwar seems nice). Most are in the denial stage, trending towards anger, so there’s a way to go. But the path is clear. In May last year, we asked the question: who will be the first well-known nationalist to return to labour? Mike Dailly, the well-known nationalist Glasgow lawyer, dismayed by lack of support, said he wouldn\u0027t vote for the SNP in August. And just last week he declared for Labour.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1513946883013713920 And last week, two polls showed a drop in SNP support and a rise in Labour support. https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1513872300596203521 Given the issues in the Conservative party in the UK and in Scotland, the likelihood of a Labour-led UK government is increasing. SNP voters have to ask themselves if they want to continue on a losing path, or hop onto a rising trend. Can Labour Be Trusted? Every day, I see lots of comments that Labour can’t be trusted with the Union. But what’s the reasoning behind this? Labour has never been a pro-independence party. They were an integral part of Better Together and fought strongly for the UK in the 2014 referendum. What changed? In a widely shared report, The Daily Mail said that 25 Labour candidates in the upcoming election expressed\u0026nbsp; pro-independence views. Sadly, that was fake news. On closer reading, it appears that the writer used out-of-date quotes and that only four were in doubt (we have asked for clarification on those). To put that in perspective, there are 1200 Labour candidates standing in Scotland in May.\u0026nbsp; Certainly, working with SNP councils is a problem: Even though Labour is currently in coalition with six SNP councils, Starmer and Sarwar have both said that they won\u0027t form an alliance with the SNP (or the Tories) to get power, either in the UK or in Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Contrary to the lies on the front-page of The National, at The Majority Meetup this month, Malcolm Cunning, Labour councillor for Glasgow’s Linn Ward, made Labour’s position very clear. There will be no alliances with the Tories or the SNP after these elections. Councillor Cunning also said he had talked to 2000 people on the doorstep, the vast majority of whom were more interested in the real issues of getting their bins collected every two weeks than any abstract constitutional question. Logically, Labour can\u0027t form an SNP alliance. If voters want separation then a nationalist party is a better choice. Labour can never be more separatist than the SNP, but they can be more authentically socialist. A vote for the SNP isn’t only a wasted vote. It’s not a progressive vote.\u0026nbsp; The distinction between Labour and the SNP is the social power of the UK. Labour can say that it will deliver social justice through a bigger pool to share from, and, to do that, they will start attacking selfish and divisive nationalist ideology more. Nationalism is fake socialism. In any case, if Labour have already taken back already-demoralised SNP voters then they have no incentive to offer them a referendum. Stop the Appeasers But there is a danger, from buffoons like Gordon Brown, lumbering in to fix the devolution mess they made, by giving even more power to nationalists who want to break up the UK. It’s time Brown stopped his continual constitutional meddling. We’ve had enough pain already. We also need to call out dangerous appeasers like the Times Appeasement Division’s Kenny Farquharson, fake Tory Andy Maciver and those in the media, who constantly invoke a constitutional clash for profit and power. By keeping the hope of a referendum alive, they maintain nationalist support. Disillusioned nationalists simply won’t come back to Labour if their illusions are being shored up. Similarly, some deluded pro-UK voters think that we should vote for Alba to split the nationalist vote. But this simply gives another avenue for hope. Instead, it should be made plain that a vote for the SNP or Alba or the Greens, is a dead-end vote for a referendum that will never happen.\u0026nbsp; The Scottish Tory party should particularly pay heed to this and stop using the ‘danger of a referendum’ to try to get votes. ‘Vote Tory to stop an SNP referendum’ should be reframed as, ‘A vote for the SNP is a vote for a referendum that won\u0027t happen. Vote for us for better local services.’ https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1507378075473960966 Righteous Anger It seems as much as Labour keep saying they’re a pro-UK party, many Tories don’t want to believe them.\u0026nbsp; I think much of this is misplaced anger about Labour refusing to form an alliance. If you believe that an alliance is the only way to beat the SNP, then you would feel righteous anger each time you see Labour attacking the Tories instead of the SNP. But, if, instead, you realise that the best way to destroy the SNP is for its voters to go back to Labour (minus the hardcore flag wavers who’ll never go back), and the cost of that is that Labour has to act like Labour, and make anti-Tory statements and policies, then perhaps that anger is midirected. Ultimately, if you\u0027re a Tory who’s prepared to tactically vote for Labour to beat the SNP in individual constituencies, shouldn’t you be prepared to understand their current strategy to beat the SNP, even if it means the cost of it is criticising the Tories? Wishful thinking on an alliance doesn\u0027t help. Getting annoyed because Labour is making anti-Tory statements doesn’t help. Time spent wishing for an alliance that can\u0027t happen is time not spent on more productive efforts. A Return to Normal Politics Don\u0027t be sad about an alliance that isn\u0027t going to happen. This is good news, because it signals the return of normal party politics, where we vote, based not on a fantasy, but on what parties can actually deliver. When Labour fights as Labour against the Tories and Tories fight as Tories against Labour to see who can best deliver what voters want in the UK, it makes them both stronger, and nationalists weaker. A resurgent Labour will squeeze the SNP even more and give the excellent attack line that voting SNP is keeping the Tories in power. And it also means that there will be less need for tactical voting. We get to vote for who we want. Going forward, our job, as a media, a movement, and as individual voters, is to make sure that Labour (and the other pro-UK parties) keep their promises. And to keep demoralising nationalist support. Time is our friend.\u0026nbsp;Once Sturgeon leaves, it’s all over. In the meantime, stop thinking we have to do something, anything, right now, to beat an ‘unbeatable’ SNP,\u0026nbsp; and stop, please stop, fantasising about an alliance that won\u0027t happen. Instead: Demoralise the SNP. Close every avenue of hope. Let Labour be Labour and watch ex-SNP come back across their anti-Tory Golden Bridge.\u0026nbsp; Mark Devlin is the publisher of The Majority.

They evaporated the illusion of free will, the idea that through grit and determination you can transcend the disadvantages of multiple deprivation and poor schooling. The outcry has been predictable, from individual pupils and parents, politicians on all sides, and educationalists. The latter group warned months ago that the SQA moderation process was dodgy. Unlike the equivalent examining body in England, the SQA was allowed to hide its methodology from scrutiny, despite suggesting to the Scottish parliament that they would explain their methods and discuss adjustments with teachers.\u0026nbsp; They only released their statistical modelling yesterday, two hours after students received their awards. It has already been dismantled, by experts in the field, for being unable to reflect individual pupils\u0027 differences. There has been verifiable incompetence at the SQA and a lack of proper political accountability - and the responsibility lies first with John Swinney, Education Secretary, and ultimately, with his boss, Nicola Sturgeon.\u0026nbsp; Moreover, yesterday’s events betrayed the SNP\u0027s utter complacency about this reality. Lockdown has significantly increased educational inequality and this gap will only make itself more keenly felt. Study after study has shown that children in poorer households did much less school work over the last five months than children from better-off homes. Instead of doing all he can to mitigate the harm done to poorer children by the pandemic, Swinney has behaved as if it is inevitable. He couldn’t even ensure that the iPads he’d promised schools were delivered to children during lockdown.\u0026nbsp; The cancellation of exams was always going to pose an issue, as was the disproportionate impact cancelling would have on the results of disadvantaged young people. Clearly, however, this wasn\u0027t uppermost in the Education Minister\u0027s mind, or he would not have allowed the SQA to fudge and hide. Instead of using actual exam results, the SQA has decided grades for students by ‘moderating’ estimated grades and pupil rankings produced by teachers. However, moderation did not affect schools equally. The pass rate of pupils in the poorest areas fell by 15.2%, compared to 6.9% for pupils from the most affluent areas. In other words, a pupil was much more likely to have their estimated grade reduced if they went to a school in a deprived area. Nicola Sturgeon blamed poor pupils’ excessive grade correction on teachers for inflating their grades in the first place, a move reminiscent of blaming GPs for accepting and keeping Covid patients in care homes, rather than hospitals, despite government policy telling them to do so. If disproportionate grade inflation did occur, it raises huge questions about teachers and teaching in deprived areas, questions which are surely critical for any minister serious about raising attainment in these schools.\u0026nbsp; Swinney valiantly tried to spin the good news yesterday, namely that there was a 2.9% increase in performance results. Overall, grades trended upwards, as they have for a number of years. Yet this too begs questions. How could performance be higher, when pupils have missed so much school? Did it have no effect? If the route to improved attainment is to keep exam-bound children out of school from March onwards, perhaps Mr Swinney should make it a permanent feature of the school year. It’s much simpler and cheaper than in-person teaching. The consolation prize of free appeals may raise some students’ grades, but it will not make up for personal disappointments and lost opportunities. When schools go back, teachers will doubtless relish administering a ten-fold increase in appeals as they deal with continuing Covid measures and the impacts of months of lost schooling. Even if appeals are successful – and what happens then to the credibility of the overall pass rate? – it will be too late for students who have missed out on university places. Many parents and pupils will look enviously at the opportunity of autumn exam resits in England; Swinney has refused to introduce them in Scotland. More importantly, appeals will do nothing to restore confidence in the SQA or Scottish education in general. Already the SNP has a track record of fighting shy when it comes to having schools inspected, or pupils assessed against international benchmarks, lest the results are less than glowing. This year’s SQA debacle is of a different order of magnitude altogether. It has brought home to thousands of families that all-important school leaving qualifications, sources of the greatest anxiety, striving and pride in many young people\u0027s lives, cannot be trusted as a fair and accurate reflection of their performance.\u0026nbsp; Morale among Scottish educationalists, already at rock bottom, will sink further still. There will be ripple effects across the entire economy, as universities and employers struggle to distinguish between candidates. No doubt some will feel they are safer relying on candidates with non-Scottish qualifications. It’s time the constant blame game stopped and Swinney and Sturgeon took responsibility for failing our children. Linda Holt is the Education spokesperson for Alliance For Unity.

David Hume was a pioneer of the Scottish Enlightenment – a philosophical movement which helped lay the foundations of classical liberalism, a way of thinking about society that would come to define the modern world.\u0026nbsp; Hume was born when the United Kingdom was in its infancy, just four years after the 1707 Acts of Union which brought Scotland and England under the governance of one parliament. Over the next three hundred years, these newly united islands would advance and defend the principles of classical liberalism imparted by Hume and his contemporaries, perhaps more than anywhere. But the Union is now on its knees. On Thursday, just over a million Scottish voters turned out to fill Holyrood with candidates from pro-independence parties in what they hope will validate a second independence referendum. At this critical time, David Hume’s ideas are as important as ever, highlighting the contradictions at the heart of the independence movement. The irony of independence lies in the friction between its emphasis on self-determination, and the nation it hopes to create. Those in favour of independence ask why Scotland, a minority population within the Union, should be unwillingly tethered to the decisions of a voting majority. What grounds, then, would there be to prevent a Scottish constituency with a pro-UK majority breaking away from an independent Scotland? For that matter, what if your local neighbourhood wanted political independence? Or even a single person? Where do we draw the borders?\u0026nbsp; Hume’s way of thinking about the nature of knowledge can also be applied to how we run our society. As an Empiricist, he believed that knowledge came from individual experiences and denounced the abstractions we make from those experiences as artificial. Just as the individual perception is the irreducible unit of knowledge, so the individual person is the fundamental unit of society. Any abstraction above the level of the individual – be it the family, the neighbourhood, the region or the nation – is ultimately artificial. It is out of these abstractions that political conflicts arise. Hume therefore knew that the only solution to these issues lies in minimising the effect of abstractions and devolving as much sovereignty as possible to the individual.\u0026nbsp; But that is something in which pro-independence voters simply do not believe. For many, an independent Scotland is seen as a collectivist utopia, with excessive focus on state provision and intervention. Sturgeon’s stringent lockdown measures in recent months have only reinforced her party’s tendency towards big government bureaucracy and its disregard for the private sector. The controversial hate-crime bill, which draws arbitrary distinctions between groups of people, was an ominous glimpse into the erosion of individual liberty that might well take place in an independent Scotland. And indeed, the whole independence movement relies on an imaginary difference between two groups of people who happen to live on either side of an imaginary line drawn up by medieval monarchs.\u0026nbsp; If pro-independence voters are keen to preserve Scotland’s sovereignty as a minority member of a larger union, then they must also acknowledge that the smallest minority on earth is the individual. Their nationalism seems to blind them to any level of devolution beyond that of the Scottish state. But self-determination does not end with Scotland. Unlike the SNP, the UK Government has the individual\u0027s interests at its core. It is hard to believe that such a flagrantly self-refuting idea as Scottish independence has persisted for so long. But it will eventually fall on its own sword. The collectivist nation that it promises to usher in is simply incompatible with the idea of self-determination. And therein lies the irony of independence. The place where pro-Indy voters want to go is undermined by the way in which they want to get there; the ends contradict the means.\u0026nbsp; Nevertheless, millions of Scots have just voted to fill Holyrood with pro-independence MSPs.

I had assumed that\u0026nbsp;they\u0026nbsp;already\u0026nbsp;were\u0026nbsp;but maybe Ross Greer, the wokier-than-thou Scottish Green MSP only\u0026nbsp;identifies\u0026nbsp;as sixteen. It is, I am forced to admit, a brilliant strategy. At a stroke ‘gammons’ and ‘boomers’ like me will be focused on this latest provocation rather than asking how the Scottish ‘government’ could possibly have\u0026nbsp;committed around £240,000,000 \u0026nbsp;in the shipyards and still have no ferries; or where the allegedly missing £660,000 from the SNP’s ‘indy fund’ is; or how it is that Nicola Sturgeon’s publisher allegedly received over £295,000 of public money prior to the publication of her ‘inspirational’ selected speeches\u0026nbsp;Women Hold up Half the Sky\u0026nbsp;(a title borrowed from Chairman Mao); or what has happened to the\u0026nbsp;£5bn\u0026nbsp;Covid support money destined for Scottish businesses\u0026nbsp;that Audit Scotland think is unaccounted for?

Away back to lick Johnson’s boots, Quisling!”\u0026nbsp;And the illiterate ones will post hysterical memes and emojis that communicate derision and disdain. It is, when you analyse it, very clever politics. Aside from the obvious point about ‘diversity’ - half-educated people with partially-formed opinions will now have their\u0026nbsp;very\u0026nbsp;own tribunes - it will provide the separatist movement with far more effective politicians. Signing up to stand for the SNP involves a self-denying ordinance that forbids any criticism of the party or its policies (I am not making any of this up). And especially not of the Dear Leader. In fact they have to agree to be on the roster of ‘clapping seals’ sitting behind the Great Helmswoman in the Holyrood chamber applauding her every utterance. (Ok I\u0026nbsp;embellished\u0026nbsp;that last\u0026nbsp;sentence a wee bit).\u0026nbsp; And it also means swallowing several Big Lies so that they can be regurgitated at will; chiefly that Scotland is a subjugated nation that subsidises the rest of the United Kingdom\u0026nbsp;– despite what those inconvenient GERS figures say -\u0026nbsp;and would swiftly rise to be a wurruld leading economy if we could only escape the ‘BritNat’ jackboot and shimmy seamlessly under the EU one. There would now be a pathway for young people to progress from the\u0026nbsp;Young Scots for Independence, the Youth Wing of the SNP\u0026nbsp;(look it up, it’s a sort of\u0026nbsp;Sturgeonjugend) into mainstream politics without the messy business of university or work experience\u0026nbsp;– which\u0026nbsp;might\u0026nbsp;risk\u0026nbsp;dangerously awakening\u0026nbsp;their critical faculties. There is only room for one chief in the SNP, what they really need is indy-ans\u0026nbsp;of unimpeachable credulity and obeisance. Nor can anyone criticise the policy for a lack of coherence. It is entirely consistent with the SNP’s big idea about treating children as adults. It follows their move to make fourteen year-olds feel grown up by asking them in a recent survey of all schoolchildren how often they have anal sex. And their determination to encourage primary school children to question their own gender.\u0026nbsp;And the Party’s so far unrequited desire to empower children by loosening the influence of parents, who may be incorrect and even heretical in their political views, and bestowing on them instead a state guardian who can guide them through their impressionable years. And of course, it is craftily coherent with their goal of ensuring that sixteen year-olds can have a vote in any Scexit referendum, as they did in the last one, while still burning with nationalist fervour from the Scottish education system’s ‘curriculum for indumbpendence’.\u0026nbsp;It would make it so much harder for the Electoral Commission – the opaque, unelected cabal of quangocrats who apparently have constitutional power over even the Queen in Parliament when it comes to deciding these things (bizarre that) – if or when they ever have to rule on the rules for another Scexit referendum. That, of course, is what this is all about, not some burning desire to empower teenagers. No, whichever way you look at it, you can’t fault the SNP’s logic.

It was 12 years, he breathlessly announced in a post called The Longest Lie, since he first debunked the notion that Scottish votes influence the outcome of UK General Elections. The last time it happened was 1964, he told his adoring followers. Quite a statistic. But is it true? Not even remotely. As in, not only is it misleading, it is demonstrably false. In every sense. It contains not a scintilla of truth. Unfortunately, it has now entered the post-modernist Scottish political lexicon along with similar myths, such as the Nationalist whine that Scotland never gets the Westminster Government it votes for. Presumably, they mean apart from the 11 occasions post-WW2 when Scotland voted for the party that won the General Election and formed the Government? To illustrate the truth, these are the General Election results from 1966 to 2010. On every occasion, Scotland voted Labour. 1966 – Labour Government 1970 – Conservative Government Feb 1974 – Labour Government Oct 1974 – Labour Government 1979 – Conservative Government 1983 – Conservative Government 1987 – Conservative Government 1992 – Conservative Government 1997 – Labour Government 2001 – Labour Government 2005 – Labour Government 2010 – Con/Lib Dem coalition So, in fact, over 12 elections, Scotland got the government it voted for 50% of the time. Such is democracy. But how often did Scottish votes influence the outcome? Not in 1966 or in 1970, when first Labour then the Conservatives won with comfortable majorities. But look what happened in Feb 1974, when Ted Heath called an early General Election to decide \"who governs Britain\". The result across the UK was: Conservative 297 Labour 301 While in Scotland the result was: Conservative 21 Labour 40 Total UK votes Conservative 11,872,180 Labour 11,645,616 In summary, England/Wales voted Conservative, Scotland voted Labour. Throughout the UK, more people voted Conservative than Labour. But because Scotland voted Labour by a sizeable majority, Labour won the election and Harold Wilson became Prime Minister. I would call that a fairly significant Scottish influence. I\u0027d love to hear an argument to the contrary. Stu? Hello? Should I go on? How about the 1979 General Election, which was called early as a result of 11 SNP MPs backing Margaret Thatcher\u0027s Vote of No Confidence in the Labour Government? That marked the start of 18 years of Conservative rule. Seems like a very significant Scottish influence, which launched the bitingly accurate mantra: Vote SNP, Get Tory How about more recently? Remember the Theresa May snap General Election in 2017? In Scotland, the Conservatives gained 12 seats from the SNP, mainly as a reaction from a Scottish electorate sick to death of Sturgeon shrieking about a second independence referendum. The final tallies by party were: Conservative 317 Labour 262 SNP 35 If those 12 Scottish Tory seats had gone to Labour or the SNP, their combined total would have been 309 to the Tories 305. If Sturgeon had only accepted the result of the independence referendum, she would have been asked to help Jeremy Corbyn to form the next UK Govt. Now, that\u0027s influence, albeit squandered. It\u0027s hardly surprising thet the peddler. with Wee Ginger Dug, of the whisky export duty myth and The Wee Blue Book (of lies) would push misinformation in pursuit of his dying cause. Perhaps this kind of misinformaton could have had a free pass in heady days of pre-referendum fervour. But this is 2024, and the old lies don\u0027t work any more. As we approach the 2024 General Election, expect to see further easily-disprovable lies in this exact vein from increasingly desperate Scottish Nationalists.

The damage it wrought in Europe in the twentieth century should have inoculated us all against it, but, once again, it has raised its ugly head. In Scotland, it has become a virulent force and made many converts in the last ten years.\u0026nbsp; I do not hate Scottish Nationalists on principle. Those who want Scotland to leave the UK are entitled to their opinion, and I respect those who say that that is what they want, no matter the consequences. If they would accept living at a singularly lower standard of living than we currently enjoy – which is what would happen – in order to leave the UK, then that is their choice.\u0026nbsp; What I deplore is the Nationalists who claim that a separate Scotland would be better off than Scotland is within the UK. Perhaps I shouldn’t hate them, but I despise the people who have fed them lies, some of them utterly blatant, about how much Scotland would prosper on its own. Because the fact is that a separate Scotland would lose £10 billion or more every year, before other costs are taken into account. I have yet to meet a Nationalist who will tell me how he or she would compensate for that. In fact, I have yet to meet one who will engage with that issue. The lies propagated by Nationalists have been developed, on an industrial scale, by the SNP’s massive propaganda machine and by a range of unscrupulous bloggers whose lies are half-way round the world before the truth has got its boots on. For example, an SNP front organisation, risibly called ‘Business for Scotland’ (BfS), has specialised in spreading lies about the UK and Scotland.\u0026nbsp; In 2018, The Ferret Fact Service found that BfS’s claim about Scotland having a positive trade balance compared with the rest of the UK, was ‘mostly false’. BfS talks about Scotland’s ‘phoney deficit’ when any respectable economist refers to it as ‘Scotland’s deficit’. In addition, individuals have created dishonest memes that are circulated by separatist groupies. On social media these are routinely deployed to try to ‘prove’ some fallacious point that the Separatist propagandists have dreamed up to delude the masses.\u0026nbsp; Current lies include the old staples about ‘the vow’ of 2014 not having been honoured. Those asserting this have clearly not read the vow, because they claim it promised all sorts of things that it does not mention. Then there is the one about Better Together having promised that, if Scots voted No in 2014, they would remain in the EU (indefinitely, apparently).\u0026nbsp; In fact, what Better Together said was, that a vote for Scexit would mean leaving the EU, which the EU Commission confirmed in writing in March 2014. It was Scottish Nationalists who voted in 2014 to leave the EU. Better Together pointed out that there might well be a referendum on EU membership, something also mentioned in the SNP’s own White Paper (pp, 217, 460).\u0026nbsp; The old chestnut about who would pay for Scottish pensions after Scexit recurs, with Separatists claiming that rUK would continue to pay them – when the SNP’s own White Paper of 2013 had said that pensions would be paid by the Scottish government (p. 429). And now we have once again the claims that the frigates promised by the UK for Scottish shipyards are not being commissioned, when what was promised was 13 ships, and what is being delivered is 18 ships. Our friends at the UK Defence Journal confirm that. It is all too easy to dismantle SNP/separatist lies and fake news claims, but the truth is drowned out by a cacophony of Nationalist lies, and those who have believed them will not listen to or read the truth. A pro-Union blogger who has done a mass of genuine research and is endorsed by reputable economists is disparaged by Nationalists in a childish and unpleasant manner and anathematised: separatists refuse to read his work because they have been told to shun it. They have been told to read/listen to only their trusted sources, while those writing reasoned argument and presenting unimpeachable facts are dismissed as ‘Unionists’ and therefore not worth attention.\u0026nbsp; How did the canny Scots of yore become the biddable, gullible Scots of the era of Scottish Nationalism? The truth is out there and can be verified, but so much of the population has been conned into believing the SNP, as the establishment, that they will accept any old nonsense that comes from their sources. This means Scotland is being set on a path that, if pursued, would damage its inhabitants and their life chances severely. What is it about Nationalism that demands a bogeyman and requires obedience to the cause, the party and the leader? We saw too much of that in the twentieth century to allow it to dominate countries again. To too many, it is an attractive, entrancing creed, flattering them by conferring on them the status of members of the chosen, superior people.\u0026nbsp; Consider Scottish Nationalists’ belief that they are morally superior to those who disagree with them and those they have designated enemies: Westminster, the Tories, London… in effect, the English. What makes them think that an authoritarian party, with no checks on the executive that is drawn from it, and presides over disasters in the devolved areas that are its remit, is morally superior to the government at Westminster that is muddling through – and providing the funds to sustain it in the Coronavirus crisis?\u0026nbsp; Part of the answer lies in social media, which spreads Nationalist propaganda like wildfire. The faithful are sent out, armed with the latest mantras from Murrell Towers, to repeat them ad nauseam. It is possible to identify these people because they parrot the same phrases: ‘independence is normal’; ‘how is Scotland uniquely unable to govern itself’? (conveniently ignoring the extensive devolution of powers); ‘the Scottish NHS outperforms the NHS elsewhere’; ‘Scotland is rich in resources and talent’, and the self-defeating catch all, ‘British Nationalist’.\u0026nbsp; These phrases and others are trotted out, word for word, by people who have not given a single thought to what they mean, or to whether they are accurate, or even make sense.\u0026nbsp;They are assimilated by Scots who like to be told that they are better, richer, more social democratic, more moral – when social surveys show that there is little difference in social attitudes between Scots and English. The time has come to get the truth out there in the public and social media arenas, and to prove that Nationalists are the liars we know they are.

Whilst the Conservatives continue to have a robust and loyal following, and Labour is increasing their vote share, with an energetic leader who, perhaps, became the first politician in history to dance in the street and not make a fool of himself. The SNP magic is gone. Dogged by damaging scandals and bitter feuds over the last six months, the party desperately needed a charismatic and energetic campaign, something they currently seem incapable of. The SNP, perhaps knowing they can no longer persuade fresh voters and scared by Alex Salmond’s Alba Party, have adopted a failing hardline core voter strategy.\u0026nbsp; In an attempt to keep their hardcore support of border flag wavers from going to Alba, the SNP have made a second referendum vote the core principle of their election, and even though they attempt to add provisos like \"when the pandemic is over\", voters only see only a party hell bent on having a referendum as soon as possible. This alienates undecided voters and those who don’t care about independence much at all, but who may have felt the SNP offered the best option for government. Don\u0027t get me wrong; there is nothing that the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon want more than for Scotland to leave the UK. Even though they have built their lives around it and they will think about it on their deathbeds (while still in the UK), when it comes to an election, it mysteriously becomes the very last thing they want to talk about. Just this week, they have been dragged into talking about hard borders, deficits and all the other unpopular logistics of Separation, which are poison to moderate voters, even those who may otherwise like the idea as an abstract choice. Instead of talking about issues voters actually care about, they are forced into angry deflections, while their opposition dances in public and gets the kind of good PR no amount of money can buy. https://twitter.com/GordonMcKee_/status/1385935122038415360 It\u0027s not just that their opponents have a new fire to them; it\u0027s that the SNP seem to have lost theirs. Nicola Sturgeon, and other leading separatists, appear bitter, resentful and arrogant in the face of questioning. That is, when she turns up. She didn’t even have the grace to give the public the opportunity to question her at the latest Leaders’ Debate, contemptuously sending a nobody instead. Like a conjurer whose tricks have been revealed, Sturgeon’s magic has disappeared in a puff of smoke. She can no longer rely on her oh-so-predictable trick of hiding her plans for separation while coyly asking voters to \"lend us your vote\", only to do a handbrake turn the day after the election and declare that any new votes were cast for one reason only. On Andrew Marr’s show, she seemed ill-prepared and out of her depth. How could the leader of a party that has had separation as its sole objective for over 80 years, say that she hadn’t made any projections of how it would affect incomes? How could she sit there and say that she would “put in place arrangements” to mitigate a hard border, when she doesn’t know how the remainder of the UK would act? How could she claim that her party didn’t want a border, when that’s what they’ve been campaigning for all these years? https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1386252221529169922 In times past, she could pull a rabbit out of the hat; Brexit! she would say with a flourish, and many would clap in agreement. But the rabbit has jumped off the stage. Brexit is rapidly diminishing in voters\u0027 minds, going from one of the most important issues in December to one of the least important now. And don’t talk about the EU’s vaccines. https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1386250665614352387 The SNP needed a good election cycle to bolster their fragile support and to achieve a majority, but every day brings a new poll, a new decline in support for separation, a decline in Sturgeon’s favourability, and a worse outlook for the SNP.\u0026nbsp; The majority they so confidently predicted just a few months ago, now hangs in the balance. Their average polling is lower than the lead up to the 2016 election. A failure to get a majority will cause a catastrophic haemorrhage that will cause them to bleed to death long before 2026. The SNP have lost their momentum and the charismatic flair that has served them well in the past. At the same time, as hundreds of thousands watch her new rival dance, an equal number watch her flounder and fail to answer questions she doesn\u0027t want to be asked, on an issue voters don’t want to hear about.\u0026nbsp; It doesn’t take a mindreader to believe that this election will not be kind to them.

I contacted Ian Lakin (@HighlandChief) through Twitter, to ask advice on my plan to create a new anti-Nationalist media. To my surprise and everlasting gratitude, he gave me a donation to get started. Soon after, I started The Majority Twitter account and was again surprised when Maureen Johnson (@Maureen6Johnson) tweeted in support. https://twitter.com/Maureen6Johnson/status/1267068856071344130 Thanks to Maureen\u0027s support, and other retweeters, in a few days we had 300 followers and we were on the way!

Huge thanks to Mary Devlin, for proofreading and advice on every article. Special thanks also to Effie Deans and Allan Sutherland. And a massive thank you to our donors. As of now, they have raised over £10,000 and are pledging over £1500 in monthly donations. If all goes well, and you continue to like what I do, I hope to make this into my full-time work next year (it actually takes up all my time now). After that, I will start to build the team and build a media that represents us, the anti-Nationalist majority, and I hope you will continue to support us in 2021. So here we are, seven months and 3600 tweets later, at the turning of the tide. The SNP have lost again, but they will come back. It\u0027s up to all of us to keep pushing, exposing their lies and breaking their false narratives. We are only a small part of what you do. Every tweet you make, every person you talk to, weakens our opponents. Their delusion is strong, but it\u0027s brittle. Once it cracks, a total breakdown is inevitable. Keep it up. Keep fighting and I have no doubt that we will put Nationalism in the dustbin of history. Have a very happy and prosperous New Year!

Mark Devlin, founder of The Majority:\u0026nbsp; While the majority of Scots want the Scottish Government to focus on the cost-of-living crisis, energy bills and a failing health service, Nicola Sturgeon has spent the past eight years dividing Scots, promoting Green extremists to government, and picking unnecessary and costly fights with Westminster. Her Gender Reform Bill is just the latest example of how out of touch she is with ordinary Scottish people’s priorities. Instead of putting rapists into female prisons, she must resign so the country can move on. A Panelbase/SundayTimes poll from Feb 11 indicated that 40% of Scots want Nicola Sturgeon to resign now , including a growing number of her own supporters.

The campaign message — STOP WASTING OUR TIME \u0026amp; MONEY, BIN YOUR PRETENDYREF\u0026nbsp; — highlights the fact that the majority of Scots reject Sturgeon’s attempt to have a referendum in 2023. A recent poll by Scotland in Union (Note 1 below) indicates only 35% of Scots support a second referendum in 2023 and 55% disagree with spending money on it. The same poll noted that less than 1 in 14 (7%) think independence is their top priority, with the vast majority of Scots wanting action on the Cost-of-Living crisis, the NHS, the economy, education and other services.\u0026nbsp; The Scotland Act says that any attempt by The Scottish Government to make laws that ‘aims to affect’ reserved areas, such as The UK Constitution, is unlawful, therefore, the Lord Advocate has asked for a Supreme Court judgement on the legality of an ‘advisory’ referendum, which would seek to find out the opinion of Scots on the independence question. Even if the Supreme Court does decide the referendum is lawful, it will essentially be a non-binding Scottish government-run opinion poll. It can not only be ignored by the UK Government, it will be boycotted by pro-UK voters.\u0026nbsp; Because the referendum is not a binding referendum, it has been labelled as a ‘PretendyRef’ by its opponents. The Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties have already indicated that they will boycott such a referendum, while The Majority intends to lead a boycott campaign on its social media channels and with further billboards. Mark Devlin, founder of The Majority: Nicola Sturgeon wants her followers to believe that there will be a meaningful second independence referendum in October 2023. However, her own Lord Advocate has told the Supreme Court that even if they win the case, that any referendum would be advisory and non-binding.\u0026nbsp;Sturgeon’s PretendyRef is either illegal and cannot happen, or her PretendyRef is legal and meaningless. The UK government can, and will, ignore it, and we will lead a campaign for the majority of Scots, who voted to remain in the UK in the real referendum in 2014, to boycott it.The majority of Scots who do not want a referendum in 2023 are frustrated and angry that Nicola Sturgeon continues to spend time and money on divisive legal shenanigans while we’re in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis and Scotland’s services continue to decline from her lack of attention and lack of funding.

Taking a different view was a matter of opinion, not of moral superiority. Certainly, there were some politicians who cast moral aspersions (in Scotland, Labour against Tories), but public personal insults were not the norm. The referendum of 2014 changed all that.\u0026nbsp; The tone was set by Nicola Sturgeon, whose idea of debate was to shout down opponents such as Johann Lamont and Alistair Carmichael. This was done on TV, with the ‘moderator’, Rona from STV, doing nothing to restrain her. No wonder some of us called it ‘Salmond TV’ at the time. I mention this because I am in no doubt that the deterioration of public discourse has been the result of SNP politicians deliberately giving a nod and a wink to their followers.\u0026nbsp; The prime recent example was when Sarah Smith, BBC Scotland correspondent, used the word ‘enjoy’ to describe Ms Sturgeon’s attitude to the access of powers that dealing with Covid has afforded her. Most of Ms Sturgeon’s followers are not sufficiently knowledgeable to know that ‘enjoy’ has more than one meaning: it can mean ‘accorded’, or ‘possess’, as in ‘I enjoy access to a private garden’.\u0026nbsp; Ms Sturgeon took exception to Sarah Smith’s use of the word, and she tweeted her hurt at it – quite consciously giving the direction to her devotees that Ms Smith should feel (even ‘enjoy’) their wrath on social media. And so they piled on, leaving a distraught Ms Smith to apologise not once but four times.\u0026nbsp; Ms Sturgeon knows how to whip up a mob, as she did in Glasgow in November 2019, during the general election campaign. She shouted through a microphone: ‘The Scotland we seek is open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive...’. It sounded more like a threat than a welcome. She continued ‘and no Tory is ever going to be allowed to change that’.\u0026nbsp; Where did that come from? Which Tory has tried to change the purported nature of Scotland? None, but Ms Sturgeon has to establish the Tories as the bad guys, the morally bad guys: ‘And down that Boris Johnson path’ (unspecified) ‘lies a future where Boris Johnson has his strings pulled by Donald Trump’. https://twitter.com/AgentP22/status/1254141253903683584 She claims this would threaten our NHS – which is entirely devolved and therefore entirely under the control of the SNP. I suspect Ms Sturgeon will be most disappointed if Trump loses the election in November. One less bogeyman to scare Scots with. The purpose of this kind of rant has been to implant in Ms Sturgeon’s followers’ minds the belief that anyone who\u0026nbsp; opposes the SNP are ‘Tories’. On social media, any criticism of the SNP is invariably met with accusations of the critic being ‘a Tory’ or supporting Boris Johnson. The leader has given the direction, and the obedient followers oblige. This allows separatists to claim moral superiority as being ‘fair’, socialist, egalitarian.\u0026nbsp; They point to all the ‘free’ things available to Scots, with which they credit the SNP, although bus travel for pensioners and personal care were introduced by the Labour/Lib Dem coalition pre-2007. Some of them even seem to think that the SNP created the NHS. That is a measure of prevailing separatist ignorance.\u0026nbsp; Further, separatists have not worked out that ‘free’ university tuition benefits mainly the middle classes but is paid for at least to some extent by those who do not attend university, including those in manual work. The consequence of ‘free’ tuition, that there is a tight cap on the numbers of well-qualified Scottish students admitted, to leave places for high fee-paying non-Scots, is generally news to separatists. The absence of fees does not mean that Scottish students leave university without significant debt. Nothing, however, will prevent separatists from claiming the moral high ground. They are ‘true Scots’, not treacherous ‘BritNats’, and that alone testifies to their moral superiority. They care more about the poor, they think, but at the same time they want to close food banks, which they regard as a blot on our conscience.\u0026nbsp; They do not know, or care, that every prosperous country – including Germany and Norway – has food banks and that in poor countries there are no food banks. The inhabitants there depend on foreign aid or else they starve. I fail to identify any moral superiority in the separatist camp. Following the SNP leadership’s lead, the faithful parrot standard SNP lies about Scotland being better off out of the UK (it wouldn’t) and of Scotland walking into the EU (it wouldn’t). They hurl abuse at those who disagree with them. They fail to identify the abuses that take place, like the bullying of businessmen and journalists. Or the case of an SNP MP who bullied a constituent (captured on film). Recently, Dave Penman, General Secretary of the FDA, the civil servants’ union, spoke of a ‘cultural issue’ in the Scottish government where bad behaviour was not challenged. ‘The issues we talk about are not historical, they are current’. There was talk of ‘bullying behaviour’ in Alex Salmond’s office when he was First Minister, and in other Scottish ministers’ offices, and that some civil servants complained of ‘operating in a culture of fear unable to speak truth unto power’. This, it is said, continues. Only today, it has been announced that Gillian Martin MSP, who was dropped as a Scottish government minister in 2018 because of ‘inappropriate and offensive’ blog posts which she had written before entering politics, has been appointed to Holyrood’s equalities committee. SNP supporters are silent on the subject of the Salmond enquiry, which is chaired by a long-standing SNP MSP, when transparency demanded that it be chaired by a judge. This committee will transpire to be as much a waste of OUR money as was the original botched case against Salmond. The signs are there to read: after all, the convener refused to allow committee members to press the Permanent Secretary on a particular issue, ruling the subject out of court, and John Swinney has refused to release documents requested by the committee. And all this is within a regime that is ruled by a married couple, one of whom is entirely unelected.\u0026nbsp; While Nationalists attempt to claim the moral high ground, Scotland is becoming a moral vacuum, and there can be no doubt about why that is so. The ruling party controls pretty much everything and ensures that the system works to its advantage. This is anything but moral.\u0026nbsp; Jill Stephenson is former professor of modern German history at the University of Edinburgh.

With Scottish independence officially set for Hogmanay 2024, the ‘divorce settlement’ is reaching the end game. The latest row exploded when Scottish government sources insisted on a share of the British Museum’s Egyptian collection. Officials stressed they were simply adapting the Salmond principle: “After all, it’s Scotland’s loot too.” Last month, the Post reported on the controversial deal to divide Lord Elgin’s historic bequests to the museum (see ‘Don’t Lose our Marbles,’ 25th Oct 2024). “Unfortunately, we had to give up some of the Greek stuff,” a negotiator admitted, after protests from Athens. Diplomats hint that Scotland may donate three torsos and a winged messenger in return for the Greek government dropping a threat to veto the country’s EU membership application.\u0026nbsp; However, plans to reallocate the remaining treasures have caused alarm at Holyrood. “They think we’re barbarians! All we get is a few Hittite tables and a pile of Assyrian back scratchers.” Exhibits from the Valley of the Kings are now a key priority for Scots negotiators. “Egypt is a red line in the sand for us,” the Post has learned. Briefings suggest a four ton bust of Amenhotep III with the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt has already been secured. Sources deny that they sacrificed everything to obtain the colossus after supporters noted the curve of the neck closely matched the First Minister’s silhouette. “It’s uncanny,” a loyalist admitted, but officials rejected accusations of political vanity. “We had no choice,” a senior member of the Scottish delegation insisted. “Anyway, the Rosetta Stone is just a glorified bingo card.”\u0026nbsp; Ministers believe that the three metre tall Egyptian icon will become an important symbol of unity between the Highlands and Lowlands, especially with Scottish regional separatism flaring up. “We’re better together,” party sources admitted, “but we have to be subtle about it.” The bust will be put on permanent display at Stirling Castle alongside a section of Pharaoh Amenhotep’s left arm and clenched first. Bleary-eyed officials are due to resume horse-trading later today. Several sarcophagi and embalmed royalty are still up for grabs. The Post has learned the First Minister personally intervened in one case yesterday. Windows rattled as she blasted the Director of Antiquities in an extraordinary late night rant, repeatedly insisting, “It’s Scotland’s mummy too!” The spokesperson for the First Minister denied talks are headed for a breakdown, but ‘No Deal’ is still on the cards – unless the mummy returns.

She answered, “When we have the powers of ‘independence’.”\u0026nbsp; In other words, the SNP-controlled Scottish Government has been unable to create the jobs they promised, but, somehow, will be magically free to create them after Scotland separates from the rest of the UK. https://twitter.com/mgoldenmsp/status/1308465183057158145 I spent several years working for three of the world’s largest corporations in London and Tokyo, and many more years as a successful entrepreneur, founding, building and running companies in Japan, USA and now in the UK. Unlike the SNP, I have created many jobs and made many investment decisions, and I know that “Independence” is a surefire jobs killer for Scotland. When companies and investors look at where to set up or expand their businesses and create jobs, they evaluate current and future requirements, benefits and risks of that country or place. These days, in Scotland, those benefits and risks are unknown because of the ‘neverendum’ -\u0026nbsp; the threat of ‘independence’. How can companies invest in Scotland when so many fundamental business questions about a possible ‘independent’ Scotland remain unanswered? Questions about the general political and economic stability, economic growth rates, exchange rate stability, general health of the banking system, interest rates, currency, borders and tariffs, higher taxation. In any possible future talks of an ‘independent’ Scotland, each one of these issues is a major topic, deserving much professional detailed study and analysis, due to their impact for investors, companies and jobs. Without answers to these issues, Scotland will always be losing out on investment and jobs. In fact, it already is.\u0026nbsp; We don’t have to wait until after the breakup of the UK, for Scottish jobs to suffer, we are already suffering from the negative effects on jobs and inward investment, just from the threat or possibility of ‘Independence’ and Scotland separating from the rest of the UK. Each year, the EY Attractiveness Survey examines the performance of Scotland and the whole of the UK as destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI), the money invested in a country by companies and investors from foreign countries. FDI should drive much of the new job creation in Scotland. After this year’s EY Attractiveness Survey Scotland was published in May, Fiona Hyslop said, “The survey is ‘another reminder’ of Scotland’s global reputation as a place for businesses to thrive.”\u0026nbsp; Overall, the report tries hard to be upbeat and present Scottish inward investment in its best light, but what Fiona didn’t mention was that, in the Foreword, Ally Scott, Managing Partner at EY Scotland points out, “The ongoing decline in new investment projects into Scotland, with a bias instead more towards follow on investments, is an underlying concern.” In other words, Scotland is losing ground in \u0027new\u0027 projects. The report continues, “Stripping out follow-on investments in existing facilities, the picture on \u0027new\u0027 projects from first-time investors is less positive for Scotland.”\u0026nbsp; In fact, the report says that the number of new projects recorded in Scotland fell by 16.3% between 2018 and 2019, pushing Scotland’s market share of all new UK projects down from 7.6% to 5.9%. In absolute terms, the number of new projects recorded in 2019 was Scotland’s lowest since 2014. This also continued a downward trend: new investments into Scotland have fallen in every year since the Referendum. It’s important to note that Scotland’s declining performance in securing new investment projects in 2019 was not mirrored across the other areas of the UK. Every other UK region either increased or maintained its number of new projects secured. This clearly shows that investment in Scotland and Scottish jobs is suffering from the ‘neverendum’.\u0026nbsp; And what if they succeeded? The reality of the ‘independence’ that Fiona Hyslop and the SNP dream of, would be a jobs nightmare, with companies, investors, capital, and our most talented workers fleeing over the hard border to safety. Scotland needs a secure future, where we can build real job creation and growth. We don’t need a heavy cloud hanging over us, dampening our potential.

How does this performance compare with its predecessor, the old Scots parliament? When the new Scottish parliament first met, on 12 May 1999, Dr Winifred Ewing, the “mother of the house”, opened the proceedings by saying, “The Scottish parliament, adjourned on the 25th day of March, 1707, is hereby reconvened.”\u0026nbsp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_aOAO0c4g This version of history has entered into history. Nicola Sturgeon, repeated it for the BBC in 2018, saying: “I was there in the chamber, and it was an incredibly emotional moment ... to see the woman who had served in the House of Commons as champion of a Scottish Parliament, served in the European Parliament, to come to a third parliament and declare it reconvened in the way she did.” Sturgeon’s version is fake history, invented for political reasons in order to deceive the Scottish people. The parliament was not “adjourned” in 1707; it was abolished, on its own motion, as was the English parliament. It could therefore not be “reconvened”, as any ex-student of Scots law ought to know. The current Scottish Parliament is, unlike the old Scots Parliament, not a sovereign body. It is a subordinate body to which certain powers have been devolved. But since nationalists are fond of comparing the two, let’s have a look at what it was really like. Let’s start by noting that the old parliament was hardly democratic. Even in 1707, there were only 4000 electors in a country with a population of more than a million. Peers sat together with representatives of the boroughs and the shires. The parliament did not meet regularly and when it did, its affairs were managed by an unelected committee called the Lords of the Articles, which essentially implemented royal business. King Charles II also convened occasional “Councils” that usurped parliament’s role and took decisions more or less by royal fiat. The parliament was powerless and was almost as ineffective a check on executive arrogance and entitlement as its modern equivalent. It was government by patronage. The Lord Secretary for Scotland, the Duke of Lauderdale, lived in London, where he made sure to keep close to the King. He had started life as a Covenanter, but ended it by persecuting them. He could do this as the only factor in his employment was how well he sat with the King.\u0026nbsp; The people of Scotland were only politically relevant if they could raise enough armed men to defy royal authority. Unlike England at the time, Scotland had nothing important in the way of a constitution. The King’s freedom of action in England was hedged about with all sorts of conventions and laws, but in Edinburgh, where Charles was also King, his power was close to being absolute.\u0026nbsp; Scotland had neither Habeas Corpus nor Magna Carta. It did not even have a properly formulated legal system, at least until Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh published the first book on criminal law in 1674 and Viscount Stair the first on civil law in 1681. Another feature of the later seventeenth century that will sound familiar to any critic of modern Scottish politics was the tremendous amount of bribery and corruption at all levels of public administration, from Lord Lauderdale himself to Sir Andrew Ramsay, who was the first Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and also a member of the parliament.\u0026nbsp; Ramsay had been elected ten times by the small clique of burgesses which controlled the capital. He raised £10,000 for Lauderdale publicly and found votes for him in parliament. In return, Lauderdale organised a private annuity of £200 for Ramsey. After Ramsey bought the Bass Rock for £400, Lauderdale arranged for the government to buy it from him for £4000, and the graft continued until Ramsey’s retirement. Nice work if you can get it. Sir George Mackenzie commented, “They were kind to one another upon His Majesty’s expenses.”\u0026nbsp; The application of law was as deficient as the making of it. Unlike in England, there were few civil rights, and “precautionary imprisonment” was not unknown. Judicial torture, used in serious cases, was not formally abolished until shortly after the Union in 1707. Witches were burned or drowned, and others were hung up by their heels or had candles burnt in their mouths. Right up to the end of the eighteenth century it was easy to enslave ordinary people if they could be described as unemployed.\u0026nbsp; The government had no forces with which to enforce the little law and order there was. There was no police force of any sort, no significant body of troops in the Kingdom and only a small, ill-armed and ill-disciplined militia.\u0026nbsp; In 1678, when the Covenanters assembled up to 10,000 armed and mounted men, the only way to restore order was to call out the Highland Host. Gaelic-speaking, claymore wielding clansmen came from the North West, descending on Lanarkshire, Ayrshire, Dumfriesshire and Galloway, looting, pilfering and quartering in the homes of the lowlanders, who were disarmed, their horses confiscated, and rendered helpless and vulnerable to the occupation force. We suffer today, not from the Highland Host, but from something almost as bad – namely the Central Belt Host. The old Scottish parliament never was, nor ever should be, a model for any modern one. Indeed, it should be a warning. Jobs for the boys, no opposition to the government, decisions taken behind closed doors, money wasted. Not to mention an untouchable monarch in the form of Nicola Sturgeon. The only way to avoid more of this is to turn the government out in May. Only then can we hope for another Glorious Revolution in Scotland, which might put the country once again in the hands of sensible, honest and decent individuals who have the interest of the community as a whole at heart.\u0026nbsp; Ian Mitchell is the author of \"THE JUSTICE FACTORY: Can the Rule of Law Survive in 21st Century Scotland?

To the cheers of the watching crowd, the Black Watch marched onto the parade square for the final time, in an event that, for many, symbolically marked the formal end of the British Empire.\u0026nbsp; Scotland\u0027s empire did not end with the disaster of the Darien Scheme in February of 1700. Instead, it would go on to be an integral part of the largest empire the world has ever\u0026nbsp;seen. Scotland, its cities and its people would grow rich and powerful from that Empire. Scotland, as we know it today, along with countless historic buildings, bank accounts, land purchases and regimental histories, attests to the indelible mark left through its role in the British Empire. On a recent day trip with my wife, I saw first-hand how empire will forever be tied to the names of Scots. We visited Eilean Donan Castle, which had been destroyed in the Jacobite war and restored in 1932 by Lt. Col\u0026nbsp;John MacRae-Gilstrap\u0026nbsp;of the MacRae clan. John was born in the Punjab and fought in Egypt and the Sudan. Above the mantelpiece, in the main hall, there’s a large portrait of him in full regimental dress, the medals of his imperial service shining proudly on his chest. In the cabinets scattered around the room, we browsed the artefacts of Empire: ornate snuff boxes, Indian daggers, ox-tail brushes and more medals. In the lower halls, posters and rolls honour the men of the Empire, and you see how the MacRae\u0027s found a home in every corner of the world under British control, from India to Australia, Africa and the Caribbean, names proudly listed under the crossed Saltire and Union flag.\u0026nbsp; Nationalists like to claim the moral high ground. Claiming that they are watching the sunset on the British Empire, they absolve themselves of its sin and use it to vilify the English further and to cast themselves as romantic revolutionaries. Yet, this denial is shameful beyond measure and in insult to those who indeed suffered under the British Empire.\u0026nbsp; Scotland had a very active role in that Empire, and its brightest and best were foremost among the \"empire builders\".

It was in the bag for Clinton. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/789083772205600768 We all know how that turned out. People like polls. Who doesn’t want to know the future? But we also like astrology too. Both sell newspapers. Do you think that Trump is disliked in America? Sure, if you listen to Democrats and the mostly Democrat-biased media. But that’s like getting an approval rating on Boris Johnson from Jeremy Corbyn. In fact, before this election, Trump had a 95% approval rating among Republicans. It is particularly difficult to get a grip on Trump’s popularity from the UK. Years of relentless anti-Trump reporting here make it almost impossible to get an unbiased picture. Reporters sent to the US from the UK are almost certainly left leaning and are condescending to Republican politics, and America, in general. They have minimal interaction with Republicans outside their bubble. By 2016, I had been living in the United States for eight years. Most of my friends were Republicans. Anyone on the ground, or should I say, not locked inside their ivory tower, could see the massive enthusiasm for Trump. I went to a Trump rally: the line to get in was half a mile long and the arena was so packed, in the end, I wasn\u0027t able to get in.These people were angry about Obamacare — which doubled their health insurance premiums and gave less benefits — and felt that they had been let down by a political establishment that wasn\u0027t speaking out for them, and who appeared to just want to play nice. Does that sound familiar, Mr Leonard and Mr Ross? Trump, for all his faults, is a brawler. A honey badger who doesn’t give up. His supporters love that he fights for them. He destroyed the other candidates in the Primaries and beat Clinton, the clear favourite, by a good margin. The Republican establishment was horrified. They became the NeverTrumpers, ever more aggrieved that the uncouth Trump was getting the results that they could not. Even after he delivered three Supreme Court justices and a host of other conservative policies, they are still bitter. Again, sound familiar? But instead of slinking off in shame, Nate Silver and the pollsters came back again with their skewed projections for this election. According to them, Trump was going to lose, and lose big.\u0026nbsp; He would lose Texas and Florida. BIden leads Trump by 10 points (Yahoo News)\u0026nbsp; Hell, no! Trump supporters have been called \u0027deplorables\u0027, \u0027racists\u0027 and worse. With all that demonisation, is it any surprise that they didn’t want to tell pollsters they would vote for a monster like Trump? You know where I’m going with this. Recently there have been a number of polls claiming there is growing support for Scottish ‘independence’. These polls are almost certainly misleading in their content and scope. My colleague, Allan Sutherland, has noted that many of the questions are based on fantasies: In their August 19th poll, the one that gave ‘independence’ 55% support, Panelbase respondents were asked: Which of these scenarios would make you more or less likely to vote for Sctottish independence?\u0026nbsp; If everyone got a basic income of £6000If the old age pension was raised from £134.50 to £330 per week. No mention of the fantasy economics that would make this possible. And The National (spit!) had an entire front page that shouted, ‘75% of Scots are ready to vote yes if they believe we’d be better off.’ Aye, right Sure, promise me a free puppy and I might say I’ll vote for independence too! All of these pro-indy polls have asked the same question: Should Scotland be an independent country? But respondents are not so favourable when the question is changed to something more realistic. When then question is reframed to ‘Should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom?’, 56% said they would vote to remain in the UK and 44% would vote to leave, when undecided voters were excluded. When the question is reframed to ‘Should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom?’, 56% say they would vote to remain in the UK. Quite a difference. The survey continued: if the pound is replaced with a new Scottish currency, then 42% would be less likely to vote for \u0027independence\u0027. If a hard border is introduced between Scotland and England, then 43% are less likely to vote for \u0027independence\u0027. While the prospect of Scotland being outside both the UK and the EU for several years would see 42% of Scots become less likely to back separation. Words matter. And there’s the scope: few in today’s Scotland want to take the risk of speaking up against Nationalism and Saint Nicola. If you run a business you’ll be boycotted; on an individual level, you’ll be sneered at and abused. Whatever you do, don’t say you are against Nicola AND like Trump! Before I started the Majority, I had to think long and hard about the abuse I, and my family, would get for standing up. Isn’t that sad? But that’s the way Nicola Sturgeon, by refusing to heal after the 2014 referendum, has divided us. If you don’t follow her divisive Nationalism you’re branded as a traitor or worse. Who wants to face that abuse? So most people keep silent and, like those denigrated Republicans, they wait to get their revenge at the ballot box. Polls are not elections and polls are not referendums. Help us fight back If you can, please pledge a monthly donation so that we can grow and be an even stronger voice against the ugly Nationalism that has engulfed Scotland.

In that time, the number of GP and consultant vacancies has increased dramatically.\u0026nbsp; As a GP, I have seen firsthand the effect of how the SNP’s chronic underfunding, higher taxation and lack of university spaces have combined to create desperate shortages in Scotland\u0027s health service. Yet the SNP, distracted by constant agitation for a second referendum, and lacking competency, is simply not doing enough to improve the situation.\u0026nbsp; GP Shortages In recent years it has become very difficult for GP surgeries to replace outgoing GP partners. How has this happened? In 2008, the British Medical Association warned that Scotland faced GP shortages. Nicola Sturgeon, who was the Health Secretary from 2007 to 2012, ignored the warning. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) now predicts a shortfall of 856 full-time equivalent GPs in Scotland by 2021. The RCGP has long called for general practice to receive 11% of the health budget in order to provide an adequate service. In 2005 it was 9.8% but by 2019, under SNP control, it has dropped to 7.35%. This underfunding had a detrimental impact on general practice - from 2013 to 2017 the number of full-time equivalent GPs in Scotland dropped by 160. In 2018, 25% of GP practices had an unfilled vacancy. GP shortages have forced practices all over Scotland to close, including those in Dumfries and Galloway, Ayrshire, Edinburgh, West Lothian, 11 surgeries in Grampian, 14 in Highlands and Islands. Long established practices gone forever. Many more practices are suffering. In 2019, 59 practices that felt unable to provide a safe service, returned their contracts to the health board to run using locums. Continuity of patient care has been lost and locums are expensive. Consultant shortages There are currently 500 vacancies for consultants in Scottish hospitals. Health boards have had to spend £102 million on medical agency locums in the last financial year alone to cover this shortfall, money that would pay for about 1000 permanent consultants. I returned to Dumfries as a GP in 1998. At that time, the hospital was full of long-term permanent consultants. Now, this excellent new hospital, with excellent staff, has 22 consultant vacancies. It is spending £7 million a year on locums, an amount that would pay for 70 permanent consultants. But, if we did not have those locums, patient care would collapse. There are many reasons for this: the after effects of the divisive referendum in 2014 dissuading applicants from the rest of the UK; higher tax rates in Scotland; uncertainty around a second vote on separation with the threat of currency turmoil, spending cuts and tax rises. Significantly, the Distinction Awards budget was frozen by the SNP in 2010. This scheme gives awards to consultants for clinical excellence. While this scheme is still available in England and Wales, there are no new awards and no progression through the scheme in Scotland. Ambitious, highly motivated consultants from the rest of the UK are therefore deterred from coming to work in Scotland, while potential Scottish consultants move south. The high level of consultant vacancies inevitably has an impact on care and helps explain why the Scottish NHS missed six out of eight national waiting time standards in 2018/19, \u0026nbsp;including Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service referrals within 18 weeks and patients starting cancer treatment within 62 days. This is not good enough. Young and old are suffering. We deserve better. Discrimination against medical students from Scotland\u0026nbsp; 1000 medical students graduate every year in Scotland, so why do we have a shortage of consultants and GPs? Why do they not stay and work in Scotland? Research shows that medical students from Scotland are twice as likely to stay and work in Scotland after graduation, compared to students from elsewhere. In 2000, 63% of medical students in Scotland were Scottish. In 2013, NHS Education for Scotland conducted a survey and found the following: In Northern Ireland 85% of medical students were Northern IrishIn England 82% of medical students were EnglishIn Wales 30% of medical students were WelshIn Scotland 55% of medical students were Scottish By 2016, the number of medical students in Scotland who were Scottish had dropped to 51%. A major effect of Scotland’s free education system is that the number of Scottish domiciled medical students who can study at Scottish universities is capped by the Scottish Government. To make up the funding shortfall, Scottish universities take on fee-paying students from the rest of the UK or abroad. This results in fewer Scottish domiciled medical students studying medicine in Scotland. Over the years, we have had enthusiastic local youngsters come to visit our Dumfries practice, desperate to study medicine. Their five As at Highers indicated that they would make excellent doctors, but they applied to Scottish medical schools and did not get in, simply because they were from Scotland.\u0026nbsp; This is an outrageous and historic failure with serious ramifications for the health service in Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Every moment the SNP continue to agitate for a second referendum is a time when they are not working to improve the health of Scottish patients.

But what does ‘mandate’ actually mean?\u0026nbsp; A standard definition (via Google) of a mandate is: The authority to carry out a policy, regarded as given by the electorate to a party or candidate that wins an election. To use a good Scottish word, this apparently simple statement gets into a fankle when it hits the nationalist mind. What does ‘win’ mean? In a referendum, as a single-issue binary question, it\u0027s straightforward to determine who wins. In the 2014 Scottish Referendum, voters could choose YES or NO, the winner being the side that received the most votes. In a General Election also, it’s straightforward: the party or parties that can create a majority, wins.\u0026nbsp; However, in recent years, nationalists have sought to redefine what constitutes a win. Initially, the SNP said it would have a mandate to ask for a Section 30 order if it received 50% + 1 of the votes cast in the Scottish Elections. As we have seen with the Brexit Referendum and, indeed, the Scottish Referendum, using 50% as a benchmark invites years of unrest, as at least half of the country is immediately against even holding the vote. But nonetheless, the SNP were not even able to gain that majority in 2021. In a rare lapse of judgement, an arbitrary target of 60% over an extended period was set by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, although it was later rolled back. The idea that the break up of the UK would be set in motion by pollsters, some of which are in the pay of The Scottish Government or run by SNP politicians, is appalling enough, but the idea that a minority of separatists, based in one part of the UK, should be able to break up the entire UK is a nationalist trope that needs to stop being indulged by UK politicians. However, as scandal upon scandal came to public attention and the polls were no longer in their favour, the SNP changed their mandate conditions. For the upcoming General Election, they said they would claim a mandate if they, along with other nationalist parties (The Scottish Greens and presumably, Alba) had a majority of votes cast. Notably, this number is far less than the total electorate. So, for example, if 50% of the electorate turns up to vote and the nationalists receive 50%+1 of the vote, then the condition would be triggered on just 25% of the electorate voting. Some might argue that if people can’t be bothered to vote that’s their problem. However, when compared to the high turnout of a referendum, this pseudo-referendum is low-quality democracy. Unable to even get 50% of the vote, though, as the polls dropped further and reality set in, the SNP changed their win condition to gaining more than 50% of Scottish seats. As the polls dropped further, that changed to simply winning more seats than any other party.\u0026nbsp; Critics, on all sides of the debate, asked, why, if the party already has the most seats, and is likely to lose seats in the election, does it not have a mandate now? Why wait until the party is in a weaker position than now to claim one? Why indeed. In fact this same argument has been applied throughout the SNP’s tenure in government, which for ‘independence’ supporters appeared to be an exercise in kicking the can down the road. Undoubtedly, when they lose over half their seats, as predicted in the General Election, the focus will turn to The 2026 Holyrood elections, where, once again, any self-defined ‘victory’ will be used as a ‘mandate’.\u0026nbsp; What is a vote worth? In a referendum we know what each vote is worth. You are either for the proposition or against it. But, in a general election or in Scottish elections, the electorate votes on a range of issues, such as health, education, the economy and so on: it’s a ‘general election’, not a ‘specific election’. Yet nationalists want us to think that every vote placed for their party is one for ‘independence’. This came to a head in the nationalists\u0027 preposterous plans to use the general election as a ‘de facto’ referendum on independence. The idea, initially promoted by Wings Over Scotland, was initially rejected by the SNP as being too extreme, only for it to be taken on by Sturgeon after she lost at the Supreme Court. It was the only can left for her to kick. In this arrangement, if 50% +1 of Scottish voters voted for the SNP, then, depending on the way the wind was blowing, either negotiations with the UK government for a referendum would be entered into, or ‘independence’ instantly declared. However, despite nationalist politicians telling us that each vote in a general election would be 100% assigned to the desire for Scottish independence, in recent polling the national question has been found to be low on most voters priorities. A February 7 poll conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies noted that: 66% of Scottish voters cite the economy as one of the three most important issues that would determine how they would vote in a General Election, ahead of the NHS (59%).\u0026nbsp; 21% of respondents cite Scottish Independence/The Union as one of the three issues that would most determine their vote if a General Election was held tomorrow.\u0026nbsp; According to the same poll, two thirds of\u0026nbsp; nationalist voters don’t even put ‘independence’ at the top of their list: Among 2019 SNP voters, Scottish Independence is only the third most commonly selected issue (35%), behind the NHS (69%) and the economy (61%). Such voters may not be particularly fussed about the national issue, but think that the SNP is better than Westminster at providing local services. In fact, these voters were invited by Nicola Sturgeon to vote for her when she said a vote for her was not a vote for a second referendum, only for those voters to find out the day after the election that their vote had been co-opted into yet another ‘mandate’ on Scottish independence. Yet, nationalists persist in the delusion that every vote for them is one for independence. This confusion over ‘mandates’ is not confined to the SNP. Before Ash Regan defected to Alex Salmond’s Alba party, she touted a Voter Empowerment Mechanism, which was just a de facto referendum by another name. The party now says: The ALBA Party believes that every single election should be used to seek a mandate to begin negotiations for Independence, not yet another mandate for a referendum. The referendum boat has sailed, the Westminster Government have continued to refuse a Section 30 order and the recent ruling by the UK Supreme Court has made holding a referendum without a Section 30 order a much more difficult task. This position is not new, the time has come to revert to what was the position of the national movement prior to devolution. The threshold would be a simple majority of votes cast for all pro-independence parties. ALBA has committed to having an explicit declaration of our intent to begin negotiations for independence, if that threshold is met, on the first line of our manifesto. All pro-independence parties should do the same. It’s on the first line of their manifesto. So it must be true then. On what authority? The implication in all of these schemes is that once the nationalists achieve their target, however arbitrary, it constitutes an unshakable ‘mandate’ to either start negotiations with Westminster about leaving the UK, or it triggers a Unilateral Declaration of Independence.\u0026nbsp; But the fact is, the independence ‘movement’ has no mandate for independence and never has—ever. Under New Labour’s devolution \u0027settlement\u0027, a Holyrood election cannot deliver a mandate for independence. The Constitution is a reserved matter, regardless of the contents of any party\u0027s manifesto, their reason for existence, or their statements to the contrary. Only the UK Parliament at Westminster can deliver a constitutionally legal and democratic mandate for independence. And to do that the SNP would have to win, or convince a majority of the 650 seats in the Westminster Parliament, which is challenging as they only field 59 candidates. Scottish Parliament elections cannot deliver a mandate: they only deliver a mandate for a party to form an administration at Holyrood to look after Scottish day-to-day matters that are not reserved for Westminster\u0027s consideration. That’s it. How many Scots actually vote for the SNP? In the 2014 independence referendum, YES received 1,617,989 votes (44.7%), a losing minority. NO received 2,001,926 (55.3%) votes on a turnout of 84.6%, the highest recorded turnout for an election or referendum in the United Kingdom since universal suffrage. The registered voters numbered 4,283,392 (the electorate) out of a total population of 5,347,600. Since then, the SNP has received the following votes and vote share: 2015 General Election — 1,454,436. This was the high-water-mark of the SNP\u0027s success and it represented 36% of the electorate in Scotland, which at the time was 4,035,400.* 2016 Scottish Election — 1,059,898 over all constituencies. 953,587 across all regions. The average of both votes is 1,006,743, which was 25% of the electorate of 4,030,000. 2017 General Election — 977,569. This was a drop of 476,867 from the 2015 election, to 24.9% of the electorate in Scotland, which at the time was 3,930,000. 2019 General Election —\u0026nbsp; 1,242,380 of the popular vote. This represented 30.65% of the electorate in Scotland at the time of 4,053,100. 2021 Scottish Election — The SNP got 1,291,204 at the constituency level, and 1,094,374 across all the regions. The average of both votes is 1,192,789 which is 27.9% of the total electorate of 4,280,923. Electorate figures from the Office for National Statistics. The SNP’s victories at Holyrood, Westminster and local council elections represent nothing more than the triumph of a small, vociferous minority. Since 2015, it has never been higher than 36% of the total electorate\u0027s vote and even less of the total Scottish population.\u0026nbsp; It only proves that a small and determined group of obsessed, loud and active zealots and extremists can force their will on the rest of the population, completely skewing the genuine will of the majority of the overall population.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; This no mandate The fact of UK Constitutional Law is that the SNP (or any other anti-UK nationalist party in Scotland or any other devolved part of the UK) simply cannot receive a mandate for independence from a devolved election. The Constitution is reserved. Winning a majority of seats in Holyrood and a majority of Westminster seats in Scotland doesn\u0027t give the SNP any mandate for independence when they only represent around a third of the total registered electorate (even less of the total Scottish population). The winning party in Scottish elections can only ever receive a mandate to form an administration at the devolved legislature to look after the day-to-day matters that are within their remit for that part of the UK. Remember back to our ‘mandate’ definition? Let’s update it with regards to the question of ‘Scottish independence’. A mandate is, according to nationalists: The authority to carry out a policy that is not in the remit of the parliament, regarded as given by the electorate to a party or candidate that wins an arbitrary target that we keep changing to suit polling conditions and redefines any vote we receive in a general election or Scottish election as one for independence. After a referendum that already settled the issue. That’s not how a mandate works. That’s not how democracy works. Yet the people who concoct these bizarre anti-democratic schemes are the first to call pro-UK politicians ‘democracy deniers’ for holding up the actual referendum result. Such is politics. It’s not surprising that these ideas have gained so much traction against hard-core nationalists — delusion is their stock in trade. What is surprising is the indulgence given to these anti-democratic schemes by the Scottish and UK media, which has almost completely bought into the ‘independence is inevitable’ myth. If it’s inevitable then any old mandate will do. But, as nationalists are increasingly finding out, reality and democracy don’t work that way.

In this alternative world in 2014, post referendum, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that two million people in Scotland had voted for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom and that the 10% winning margin —\u0026nbsp; which meant 24% more people voted NO than YES — was clear and decisive.\u0026nbsp; To show their acceptance and heal the wounds of the divisive, “once-in-a-generation” referendum, three days after the referendum, they attended the service of reconciliation which the Church of Scotland had organised at St Giles Cathedral. Salmond and Sturgeon then returned to the Scottish parliament vowing to devote all their energies to the public services of Scotland, to demonstrate the competence of the SNP in government. They spend the next six years on ‘the day job’ improving Scotland’s health, education and economy. And then, after the EU referendum, while professing disappointment at the result and declaring the belief that the UK had made a bad decision, Nicola Sturgeon pledged to do all in her power to help the UK government negotiate the best deal possible with the EU, for the benefit of the people of the UK and Scotland. With one important proviso: if Brexit turned out to be as disastrous as the SNP claimed, then she would consider another independence referendum after ten years had passed. Democratically sound and principled, this approach would, I’m sure, have been respected by many on the pro UK side of the debate. But, alas, we must return to the real world. And we all know what really happened. The results of two referendums, disrespected and disputed by the SNP.\u0026nbsp; Let’s not forget that the Independence referendum was preceded by the Edinburgh Agreement between the United Kingdom Government and the Scottish Government, which said: The governments are agreed that the referendum should: have a clear legal base;be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament;be conducted so as to command the confidence of parliaments, government and people; anddeliver a fair test and decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect A result that everyone will respect. This most serious agreement, with the potential for the break up of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, was signed by David Cameron, the Prime Minister, and Michael Moore, Secretary of State for Scotland and Alex Salmond, the leader of the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon, deputy leader of the SNP. But the signatures of Sturgeon and Salmond on this historic agreement meant nothing. They did not respect the result. They did not respect democracy. They began, almost immediately, to campaign for a second referendum. They have never let up on their divisive quest for separation, that continues\u0026nbsp; even now, six years on.\u0026nbsp; The SNP also behaved badly after the EU referendum. After making little effort to actually campaign to remain in the EU — the SNP spent more on a by-election on Shetland than the EU referendum —\u0026nbsp; the SNP responded to the vote by complaining ad nauseum that Scotland had been “dragged out of the EU against its will”.\u0026nbsp; But Scotland was not on the ballot paper. The vote was whether the UK should remain in or leave the EU. And the majority of people in the UK voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy this vote must be respected.\u0026nbsp; Politicians in the western world love to trumpet their belief in democracy, but it is easy to approve of democracy when you are winning. The real test is when you lose a vote on an issue that you hold dear. And too many\u0026nbsp; politicians have failed that test, in Scotland and the UK as a whole.\u0026nbsp; No political party has been as anti-democratic as the SNP.

Sturgeon has asked for a Section 30 order twice: once from Theresa May and once from Boris Johnson. She was refused both times. The British Government has used various reasons for refusal, such as: The Edinburgh Agreement, signed by Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond, said the 2014 referendum was held to\u0026nbsp;‘deliver a fair test and decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respectThe result showed a clear majority of Scots wanted to remain in the UKIt is a low voter priorityA consistent threshold of 60% in polling is reached (something we reject - our country shouldn’t be up for auction by poll results)Now is not the time, due to COVID, Ukraine crisis, etc But the main reason it won’t grant one is because it doesn’t have to. The Scottish Government has no way to force an S30.\u0026nbsp; A Worthless Mandate Nationalist voters claim that the 2021 Scottish Election result, returning 64 SNP MPs (one short of a majority), gives them a ‘mandate’. But that ignores that a second referendum is outside the remit of the administration they were voting for. It would be like voting for your local council to send tanks into Ukraine: it simply doesn\u0027t have that power.\u0026nbsp; Section 29 of The Scotland Act 1998 is quite clear about the limits of the Scottish Government’s power: Legislative competence. An Act of the Scottish Parliament is not law so far as any provision of the Act is outside the legislative competence of the Parliament.A provision is outside that competence so far as any of the following paragraphs apply—it would form part of the law of a country or territory other than Scotland, or confer or remove functions exercisable otherwise than in or as regards Scotland,it relates to reserved matters…For the purposes of this section, the question whether a provision of an Act of the Scottish Parliament relates to a reserved matter is to be determined, subject to subsection (4), by reference to the purpose of the provision, having regard (among other things) to its effect in all the circumstances. Note the words “to its effect”. If an advisory referendum’s aim is to effect the Constitution, a reserved matter, then it is outside the legislative competence of the Scottish devolved administration.\u0026nbsp;Sturgeon and her useful idiots in the media, have fooled and continue to fool, her followers into thinking she has a power she is not entitled to. Talk of a ‘mandate’ also ignores the fact that the Conservative Party, which is in government, also has a mandate not to grant a second referendum, a point made by Wings Over Scotland’s Stuart Campbell: Johnson absolutely DOES have both the moral and political right to refuse. He has the political right because Westminster – as Nicola Sturgeon never tires of reminding us by refusing to countenance an “illegal” vote – is sovereign over Holyrood, and he controls Westminster. And he has the moral right because he stood for election just nine months ago on an unambiguous manifesto pledge of refusal, and he won a clear majority in the UK parliament on that manifesto…You cannot say “our manifestos and mandates count but their’s don’t” and expect anyone, let alone the international community, to take you seriously…Those competing rights represent an irresistible force and an immovable object, and you don’t shift an immovable object by sulking and stamping your feet and shouting at it that it has no right to be immovable. You have to act. (Note that Campbell acted by giving up.) But Campbell is wrong: these two mandates aren’t actually equal. The Scottish Government claims a mandate for a power it doesn’t have, while the UK Government claims a mandate for a power it actually has. A Powerless Movement So how can the Scottish Government force the issue? They could organise mass protests, but recent protests are in the hundreds, even including the dogs that tag along for the walk.\u0026nbsp; SNP MSPs could engage in some kind of passive resistance, but it would only highlight that they aren’t doing ‘the day job’. For it should be remembered that The Scottish Assembly wasn’t set up as a pathway to independence. It wasn’t set up as a talking shop for independence. It wasn\u0027t set up as a place to foment grievance against the UK. It was set up to improve the lives of Scots. Really. The SNP have used the past 15 years in power to lever the Scottish parliament into a forum for grievance and breaking up the UK, instead of using it to improve education, housing, crime, drug deaths, while brushing away a huge litany of scandals, crimes and misadventures under the magic carpet of ‘independence’. We Don\u0027t Need No Stinkin\u0027 S30 So, if the SNP can’t force an S30 what can they do? Back to Gordon Ross in his car, somewhere in deepest Partick, and his inside track to Mike Russell. According to Ross, and assuming he\u0027s telling the truth, Magic Mike says the SNP don\u0027t need an S30 at all! Mike told Ross that an S30 was a ‘nicety’ and a ‘kind of gentleman’s agreement’ that is ‘merely an invitation to the UK to participate formally, and inviting it to recognise the result’.\u0026nbsp; Russell told Ross that SNP intends to not ask for an S30 and hold an ‘advisory’ referendum instead. They are not worried about ‘Unionists boycotting the vote because for them any positive result will stand, even with a lowered turnout. The result of the real referendum in 2014 will be cast aside and the advisory referendum result will also be used to say that ‘The Scottish People™ want independence’ with separatists claiming that every action taken by the UK Government to defend itself is ‘against the will of The Scottish People™’. They are not worried about any court action by the UK Government, which Ross calls ‘a legal challenge by Boris Johnson in ‘his own Supreme Court in England’ as it ‘cannot trump Scots law’. I’ll add now, for the sake of reality, that this is false: The UKSC can hear \u0027devolution issues\u0027, which include questions about whether a Bill or Act of Parliament, or any provision of a Bill or Act of Parliament, is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or the Northern Ireland Assembly. According to Russell, pro-indy MPs in Westminster, who he calls ‘the legitimate, unrestricted, Scottish parliament sitting in The English Chamber’, would return to Scotland, where they would legislate to repeal the ‘voluntary’ Acts of The Union, which Ross says ‘can be repealed by either side’.\u0026nbsp; Quite how this would be done is not explained, most likely because it can’t be done. The Scottish Government, whether it has the result of its referendum in its favour or not, has no competence to legislate on reserved matters, and The Scottish Government is not a party to The Act of Union. Ross says a Declaration of Independence would follow. Quite how an ‘advisory’ referendum can be used to do this is also not explained. The strategy amounts to: use an advisory referendum, that has as much validity as an opinion poll, as a PR tool. Then issue a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI).\u0026nbsp; An Opinion Poll + UDI = Danger UDI is a dangerous strategy that puts the anti-democratic views of a minority of separatists against the democratic wishes of the majority of Scots who voted to remain in the UK in a legal, free, fair and decisive once-in-a-generation/lifetime referendum. UDI will likely be a trigger for civil unrest and possibly violence. At this point, separatist leaders will face arrest (see Catalonia). Ross then says the referendum result would be used to engage international agencies, citing the Scottish Sovereignty Research Group (SSRG)’s plan to join the European Free Trade Association EFTA, which is a regional trade organisation and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. According to SSRG,: Prior to the May elections, the SSRG asked EFTA if the Scottish Government were to use these elections as a plebiscite for independence, would they consider this as legitimate grounds to join. They responded affirmatively, provided the Scottish Parliament affirms its sovereignty thereby acquiring the competence to negotiate international treaties, and the powers to abide by them…Once sovereignty is affirmed, Scotland can join EFTA and re-join the EEA within weeks. The four freedoms of movement Scotland lost with Brexit: people, goods, services, and capital, would be restored. EFTA has already negotiated post-Brexit trading arrangements with the UK. Scotland joining EFTA will also facilitate cross-border trade between an independent Scotland and England. That means a hard border. By the way, a ‘plebiscite election’, the idea that a General Election can be used as a proxy for a referendum, is bogus. That’s what referendums are for. And it amounts, once again, to UDI. The SNP would then aim to get recognition from the EU and the UN, where Ross believes that any dispute with the UK would become a matter of ‘international law\u0027. Russell, through Ross, says this process will take just three years. The referendum in 2023 (now apparently delayed due to the Ukraine crisis); the recall of MPs and repeal of the Acts of Union in 2024; international recognition in 2025. Ross, and presumably Russell, see their plan unimpeachable. They say that there can be no legal challenge to an advisory referendum (there will be), that a boycott only helps them (it won’t) and that international agencies will support (unlikely). Their plan amounts to UDI, pushed through on the basis of a government run opinion poll.\u0026nbsp; Pretendyref or not, we must get ahead of the fight Nonetheless, there is a real danger that an advisory referendum, should it go ahead, would give separatists a significant PR win. As it stands now, the UK Government is able to say that the matter was settled by Scots in favour of remaining in the UK. But a pro-independence result, even for an boycotted advisory referendum, can cause significant trouble, as political and media troublemakers and external influences use it to try to attack the UK government. Most worryingly, by allowing these plans to go ahead, the UK and pro-UK voters will be put into a defensive position. It is vital to get ahead of their plans. This means: The UK Government should:Make clear that so-called ‘independence’ referendums are actually about breaking up the UK and affect all UK citizens.State that the only path to breaking up the UK is through the UK Parliament. Get a majority there and separatists can do what they like. Say they will aggressively fight and dedicate resources to maintaining the UK’s territorial, social economic and strategic/military integrity.Amend the Scotland Act to explicitly disallow any further referendums on the constitution by the devolved assemblies. Scrap Section 30 OR write into the Ministerial CodeRemove funding and civil servants from any work on the referendum. If they persist, remove them from office, with penalty.Remove UK funding, such as Short Money, from the SNP and other separatist parties if they continue to advocate for the break up of the UK. (Separatist parties can raise private money if required).Consider banning secession, as many other countries do. Say that any party issuing a Unilateral Declaration of independence will have its leaders arrestedForce the renaming of the ‘Governments’ back to Assemblies, to reflect their true status as devolved administrationsInstitute robust ‘checks and balances’ to ensure that Scots are not being deprived of rights that other regions of the UK have, and that funding is being spent effectivelyPressure EFTA to disavow entreaties by Scottish separatists Institute a ‘Logan Act’ that would stop any body except the UK Government seeking or negotiating international treatiesEnsure that any Scottish Government overseas spending is not spent on promoting the break up of the UKWe must identify ways in which a “People’s Challenge”, by Scots, on behalf of Scots, can challenge the Scottish Government’s plans. There has been some discussion that the Lord Advocate\u0027s decision to pass a Referendum Bill could be challenged through judicial review and we will shortly start a crowdfund to start the process by getting expert legal advice.We must get commitments from UK parties that they will boycott any illegal referendum. This may be challenging for Labour, but it would perhaps bolster their recent commitments to the UK.We must get commitments from local authorities that they will not enable an illegal referendum The SNP will never stop agitating for a second referendum. They act like they never lost in 2014, while the UK acts like it never won. As we have found in Scotland, a country cannot move forward when it is under constant threat of breakup from a minority of separatists, especially after they were defeated in a free and fair referendum that was supposed to settle the issue decisively.\u0026nbsp; It’s time to stop their divisive plans once and for all, and finally secure the peace Scots deserve.

For some time now, the SNP, under Nicola Sturgeon, has attempted to portray itself as a paragon of virtue and truth. The party proclaims itself as anti-discriminatory, anti-racist, anti-sectarian, and anti all-things-objectionable-to-a-tolerant-and-civilised-society. Defender of the bastion of Jocktopia. When Nicola Sturgeon strutted her rant at George Square last December, she advised us of her ‘vision’ for Scotland. Apparently, the ‘New Scotland’ is to be open, welcoming, tolerant and inclusive (no Tories please!). These attempts at moral and political excellence are lacking in balance. Rather than start from a solid base of ethical conviction, the SNP has always been willing to attach itself to any convenient cause. The difficulty with this pretence of virtue is that it tends to embolden or fade as a direct consequence of who is stating any given issue. In his ‘Notes on Nationalism’, George Orwell observed, ‘the Nationalist does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but has a remarkable capacity for not hearing about them.’ Orwell added of the Nationalist, ‘actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them and there is almost no kind of outrage...which does not change its moral colour when it is committed by ‘our’ side’. So, is Orwell’s analysis of Nationalist actions accurate? Let’s consider some examples. In May 2020 Maajid Nawaz, LBC radio presenter, urged Nicola Sturgeon to apologise after he claimed he was racially targeted by SNP supporters who disagreed with his views over Brexit. Maajid accused the SNP of ‘left wing racism’. There was no response from the party leadership. In 2018 Julia Dettbarn, an SNP councillor in South Ayrshire, used the ‘n’ word in her social media account. Despite the claim being upheld, the good councillor was sent for ‘awareness training’. She continues to serve as an SNP councillor. During the 2019 General Election campaign, the SNP prospective candidate for Kirkaldy and Cowdenbeath was found to have used anti-Semitic language in his social media account and admitted his comments were ‘clearly unacceptable’. He was accepted back into the SNP and continues to serve as an MP. In November 2020, Joanna Cherry, SNP MP and party Spokesperson on Justice and Home Affairs, had been subject to death threats. These threats were taken so seriously that Ms Cherry was offered protection from both Police Scotland and London’s Metropolitan Police. The three threats were apparently from a group of militant trans-rights activists operating within the SNP.\u0026nbsp; No support has been forthcoming from the party leadership. While in January, John Mason, SNP MSP, advised us that he would not be speaking up for those who wanted lower taxes and was screening constituents on their political loyalties when they contacted him through his website. Presumably to disenfranchise those who did not agree with his views. No action was taken by the party leadership. Contrast this silence and minimal intervention approach to the attitude from the party leadership in relation to recent counter demonstrations in Glasgow. The leadership could not, as usual, get in front of a microphone or reach for Twitter quickly enough to tell us about ‘racist thuggery’, ‘zero tolerance’, how ‘completely appalled’ they were and that the scenes were ‘utterly shameful’ and the ‘full force of the law’ was threatened. The outrage is as hysterically imbalanced as the previous examples were non-existent. Indeed, the Police Federation were prompted to issue a statement saying, ‘The public cannot expect the police service to turn a blind eye to those who break the law in the name of a particular cause whilst demanding different treatment for opponents’. What the SNP offers is lacking in any moral credibility and has no consistency in its approach. While attempting to present itself as a party of upright righteousness, it fails spectacularly, and as Orwell said, is guilty of ‘changing its moral colour when it\u0027s ‘our’ side’. Let us be clear, what is on offer from the SNP is not Mandela-like statesmanship – no issues of deeply held moral principle. It is much more Orwellian than that: Whenever Nationalists do bad things, it simply goes down the memory hole. Matt M is a freelance writer based in the Central Belt. Help us fight back Next May there’s going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nationalists will use it tocontinue to\u0026nbsp;agitate for a disastrous referendum.

Anything to make a buck – or whatever damn currency we could get hold of.” “I even wanted to raise the pension age and return to Scottish Calvinist values – things I’d denounce as evil ‘neo-liberalism’ if anyone else had tried it. Worse, I bought up cheap flats to rent them out after the post-Indy repossession crisis.”\u0026nbsp; But, as Heckle admits, it was his wife who first saw the change in him. “I was blind to it, myself.” At Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Professor Clare McArthur is researching a stream of cases with what is known as Stevenson’s Syndrome. “It’s high-profile sufferers are often idealists whose passions lead them – under extreme pressure – into chronic two-facedness.” Under the professor’s care, Dr Heckle is now coming to terms with the condition. “My alter-ego, Indy Hyde, was driving me to the abyss.” But the personality split was, he suggests, dormant for many years. “I was living a lie. Ultimately, my heart declared independence from my head.” Heckle believes Indy Hyde is driven by a deep-seated belief that Scottish independence must be pursued at ANY price. In fact, the greater the sacrifice, the more noble the cause. “Of course, I tried to deny it. I would always make sure every right-wing policy announcement had a gesture to the progressive left – gender-neutral toilets or a ban on deep-fried Mars bars. I was proud of myself for such skilful presentation. But therapy has helped me realise how much I was kidding myself.” Prof McArthur believes sufferers need support and sympathy. “It’s a myth to think politicians are lying to us. The reality is, they’re lying to themselves. Often, they try to shift the blame onto traitors or terrorists, but for Scottish sufferers it’s usually Westminster...or Whitehall...or whingers closer to home.” Relaxing in the warmth of their Morningside conservatory, Dr Heckle (and Indy Hyde) are now at ease, able to openly self-identify as bi-political. “It’s liberating. We feel so free. Of course, we’ll miss the cut and thrust of party politics, but we consider ourselves strangely lucky,” they smile with relief. “And don’t forget...we’ve always got the rent from our flats if we feel a wee bit down,” says Heckle.\u0026nbsp; “Yeah...strange how things turn out,” nods Hyde with a wink.","date":"2021-02-13","summary":"The Scexit Files: Sunday Herald, 15th July 2026 “I lied in good faith.”\u0026nbsp; With those words, Dr Jim Heckle, the Minister for Strategy in the post-S..."},{"title":"The tide has turned","url":"/articles/the-tide-has-turned/","content":"Since the 2016 Brexit referendum, uncertainty and pessimism have been the SNP\u0027s strongest allies, allowing them to recover their electoral losses and encouraging them to stir up evermore grievance for their own advantage. If they were really committed to European ideals and the common market, they would have supported Theresa May\u0027s failed deal. However, they thrive on uncertainty. They were willing to sacrifice the stability, prosperity and social well-being of Scotland, and the UK, in pursuit of that uncertainty. They played their cards, and now their bluff has been called. To their horror, the \"vanishingly small\" chance of getting a Brexit deal has come to fruition. They knew that Brexit was a more significant concern to the Scottish electorate than Separation; they knew they could exploit the many concerns. They played the cards they dealt themselves as any political opportunists would. On the one hand, they cried wolf, and with the other hand, fed the wolf. But, they can\u0027t do that any longer.\u0026nbsp; Some of you may remember the panic at the end of the last century, surrounding the\u0026nbsp;\"Y2K\" scare, when the world realised that computer programs that had been written using only two digits to represent the year, made the years 1900 and 2000 indistinguishable. This computational timebomb, based on the incorrect display of dates, and the calculations based on those dates, was feared to cause global collapse and Armageddon. Nuclear weapons would explode in their silos, power grids would collapse, and satellites would fall from the sky.\u0026nbsp; Y2K fed a worldwide panic. A distant American cousin of mine spent the year beforehand building up a private arsenal that would make the military of a medium-sized country jealous. But then the millennium arrived, and the world didn\u0027t end.\u0026nbsp; Y2K would have happened, just as a no-deal Brexit would have happened, had it not been for the tireless efforts of many people determined to prevent it. In Y2K\u0027s case, programmers, governments and private individuals reprogramed the world\u0027s computer systems, and though there were a few glitches on the 1st of January, 2000, the date and the fear passed faster than the hangovers we all had from welcoming in the new millennium. Brexit will be much the same. Yes there will be some bumps in the road, a few misfiled forms, a few trucks slowed, and a few pet passports not applied for, but overall the date will pass with little significant change, as the world continues to grapple with the global COVID-19 pandemic.\u0026nbsp; However, just like the extortionist profiteers that prayed on the fears of many in the runup to Y2K, the SNP and associated Separatists and Nationalists will find themselves in a difficult spot when the dust settles and people realise they have been had.\u0026nbsp; The SNP has used the fear of Brexit, the uncertainty of the pandemic and the frustrations of millions of people impacted by them, to further their cause, as a doomsday cult promising salvation; \"the end of the world is nigh\". That which propelled them is now draining away as the deal passes. But all these, even COVID, will pass. At this article\u0027s writing, over\u0026nbsp;600,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered so far, with projections for a further 200,000 per week. The Oxford vaccine, one not hampered by logistical issues, such as -70-degree storage, is now poised to be approved and will exponentially increase that number.\u0026nbsp; As the fear of these things pass, people\u0027s attention will naturally focus on recovery. After nearly a decade of upheaval, voters are crying out for stability and solidarity. They will reject further division and uncertainty, knowing it can only harm our prospects of rebuilding from a period of social upheaval not seen since the end of the Second World War.\u0026nbsp; The SNP is in danger. Brexit is resolved. The pandemic is being tackled at home and abroad with evermore effective weapons. Grandstanding opportunities for free media attention and unchallenged directives, are rapidly passing.\u0026nbsp; As the pandemic and Brexit recede, only their scandals and their myriad failings will be exposed, like crabs left on the shore after the tide turns. As the SNP\u0027s tools are stripped from them, the UK government will have a lot more time and resources to devote to defeating them. They are primed with success, having pulled off an \u0027impossible\u0027 feat. Nationalists will no longer be able to use our darkest hour to hide.\u0026nbsp; I leave you with this thought. In 1945 Winston Churchill may well have felt very confident about his chances of re-election. After leading the nation through the war to defeat Western Axis powers, with the Japanese posited to follow, to many he would have seemed untouchable. Yet, he lost, and a new government concluded the war and built the Britain we know and cherish today, from the ashes of six years of destruction.\u0026nbsp; The SNP now find themselves in much the same position, and they know it.\u0026nbsp;","date":"2020-12-30","summary":"Since the 2016 Brexit referendum, uncertainty and pessimism have been the SNP\u0027s strongest allies, allowing them to recover their electoral losses and ..."},{"title":"The Ulsterisation of Scotland","url":"/articles/the-ulsterisation-of-scotland/","content":"I have spent most of my life as a soldier. I served six tours of duty in Northern Ireland between 1975 and 1995 before retiring as Regimental Sergeant Major in the Black Watch. I have seen a country tear itself apart before and I fear that we, as all who fail to learn from history, may find ourselves repeating it. I know that nowadays marches and large public gatherings seem like a distant memory, but those days will come back and with it, possibly, may come the start of our repeated history.\u0026nbsp; It is not difficult to imagine what may go wrong. A heated election delayed due to the pandemic and a divided party seeking to unify its support base “one last time”, yet again. A protest is met by a counter protest, a shout met by a slur, a punch met by a bottle, vandalism met by destruction. It doesn’t matter who started it, it never does, but each step is an escalation, a chain reaction made more volatile by months of pent up frustration, anger and sadness. Before too long it all gets out of hand as a woefully underfunded police force, a cohort of provocative politicians and a charged ideological atmosphere combine to unleash a monster that cannot be contained.\u0026nbsp; Of course, no one wants this, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions and empty promises, two things which we certainly have in surplus in Scotland today. I am not the first to recognise this, and to sense the volatility that is now present in Scotland. Jamie Blackett, the leader of All for Unity, a party I myself am standing for, was a Guards Officer who also served in the Province. All for Unity’s founder George Galloway also had in-depth knowledge of the Troubles from a different viewpoint, as a leading advocate of a united Ireland. We are all on the same side now. When people who disagree on so much are united on an issue such as this, the alarm bells should not just be ringing, but falling off the wall. The Troubles are over in Northern Ireland thanks to the Good Friday Agreement. But the three of us recognise the signs of a new phase of the Troubles being fomented – a Scottish Troubles. It was a determination to put a stop to this that brought the three of us together in All for Unity. The SNP regard Sinn Fein as allies. We already have a ready-made sectarian issue in the country, with a few would be “freedom fighters”, posting photographs of a hand holding an Armalite rifle against the Saltire; a variant of an old IRA favourite. Another Walter Mitty character with his deluded band of brothers recently recorded, then posted, their battle plan on social media, which included the use of a high-powered rifle picking off British police officers on the border. https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1354882469175185411 These fools have clearly never known the horrors of what they idealise. These incidents must be taken seriously and investigated. We now have Joanna Cherry QC MP and Angus McNeill MP advocating the approach taken by the Irish Revolutionary Government in 1919 – 1921, vocally supporting a form of Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). A formal process leading to the establishment of a new state by a substantial entity which declares itself independent and sovereign without a formal agreement with the state from which it is seceding. Day after day, we watch Nicola Sturgeon and her supporting cast of neds, refuse or scorn offers of assistance from Westminster to speed up the crucial vaccination process. They avoid using the term “British”, when referring to The British Army. They delete the word “Oxford”, when describing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. They have encouraged their followers to avoid buying goods that sport the Union Flag. In my opinion, this anti-British rhetoric is racism. The SNP and notably, Nicola Sturgeon, are stirring up and encouraging hatred towards our partners in the United Kingdom and all things British. Make no mistake – the situation in the present political climate could easily result in civil disorder and violence. The leadership of the separatists take every opportunity to pour their inflammatory bile onto the fire of nationalism. This is an extremely dangerous practice. It has already caused friction between friends, and even families throughout our land, our Scotland, and could easily lead to catastrophe.\u0026nbsp; I fear for Scotland and write this as an individual with extensive hands-on experience in hostile environments.\u0026nbsp; It doesn’t take a great deal of imagination to see where one incident, such as a particular Civil Rights march in Londonderry in the late 60’s, could be replicated on the streets of Glasgow or Dundee. In the words of Bernadette Devlin: Derry is a dead city: about one in five of the men is unemployed and the whole feeling is depressed. But it was electric that day. You could see the people’s faces – excitement, or alarm, or anger. Derry was alive. The rest is now a chapter of our bloody history. I fear for Scotland. The signs of Ulsterisation are everywhere and it must be stopped. The only sure way of doing that is for all pro-Unity politicians to come together to defeat the SNP in the upcoming election and ensure that the SNP are no longer able to form a government.

The masterful speech echoes in the current debate on nationalism within Scotland, for with the SNP it is also always a case of \"do as we say and not as we do\" and that is most obviously visible in their demands for a second independence referendum. Nationalists don\u0027t want us to act as they do because their actions portray the rank hypocrisy of their position and their manipulation of reality to suit their perpetual fostering of grievance and agitation in a time when solidarity and unity is more vital than ever.\u0026nbsp; Let us look at some examples of the SNP\u0027s contradictory actions and how they influence the debate on a second referendum, if one ever even happens. #1 Scotland being pulled out of the EU is grounds for a second independence referendum I\u0027m not going to cover how this vote was UK wide, even though that is a fundamental distinction that is wilfully ignored by separatists. Instead, if we are to follow the reasoning of this argument, it stands that in any hypothetical future vote, any region of Scotland that votes to remain in the UK has a right to demand that its wishes be honoured, as expressed in the referendum, and for it to remain part of the UK. For example, ignoring the wishes of The Borders or Shetland and Orkney would demonstrate a profound democratic deficit and would be against the settled will of the people of those regions. This would, of course, result in the partition of Scotland, with the vast majority of Scotland\u0027s geographic landmass most likely choosing to remain in the UK. The SNP cannot argue against this position without contradicting their own demands. Not only do we have the precedent of the SNP\u0027s own statements, but we also have a constitutional precedent in the form of Northern Ireland. Secessionism would lead to the partition of Scotland.\u0026nbsp; #2 Brexit requires a confirmatory referendum Boris Johnson was not the only one to drive around in a bus with slogans emblazed on the side. The SNP\u0027s rejection of Theresa May\u0027s much softer Brexit is why we find ourselves in the present situation, and it shows that, despite the SNP\u0027s opposition to Brexit, they wish it to be as disastrous as possible, to further their political objectives. https://twitter.com/nicolasturgeon/status/1202616357910695941 However, applied to the constitutional question, former PM, John Major, has argued for a double referendum, with people voting first on the principal and then on the arrangement, with either vote having the power to veto secession. The SNP should be all in favour of this, after all, they campaigned continuously for a second Brexit referendum. However, as with Brexit, they fear that once the real complexities and cold reality of breaking a 47-year union, let alone a 300-year-old one, would result in people vetoing the vote yet again. However, if they are to remain true to their slogans and policies, they must allow such a vote, should Westminster or anyone else decide upon it. #3 Ignoring the demands of Holyrood concerning the release of material for the Alex Salmond inquiry Not only has this inquiry threatened an all-out civil war in the party, horrifically damaged the lives of all the women involved in the complaints, become a total farce, and ridden roughshod over Holyrood as a democratic organisation, it sets a precedent for any future referendum bills. For if the SNP feel that they are free to reject the demands of a majority of the elected representatives of the people of Scotland, what stops anyone else doing so? The Prime Minister, whoever that may be in the future, can turn around and point to this moment and declare that the SNP themselves have ruined all credibility in Holyrood. Again, we see that in this constitutional grievance wrangling, at a time of unprecedented hardship for millions of people, with the SNP it is always a case of do as we say and not do as we do.\u0026nbsp; The SNP should be well warned of the precedents they have set. They should abandon the tired old arguments that have been yelled across virtual and physical barricades for a decade, and should instead, fulfil the promise of devolution: to better the lives of us all, combat poverty, increase access to education, and represent all of Scotland -- not only those who they agree with. If a referendum ever happens again, it will not be like 2014: the questions and answers will be different. Nationalists can only fool some of the people all of the time. Their legacy, if they ever achieve their goal, will be more partition, poverty, division and betrayal.","date":"2020-11-24","summary":"In a recent speech to the Irish Dáil (parliament), Heather Humphreys, TD of the Fine Gael party, reproached Sinn Fein, saying that with Sinn Fein \"it ..."},{"title":"The war on your thoughts","url":"/articles/the-war-on-your-thoughts/","content":"The SNP’s obsession with being perceived as morally superior is the glue they collectively sniff before composing any public messaging. No matter the issue, rest assured that it cannot possibly be the SNP’s fault. Gone are the days of accountability, gone are the days of owning up to something and the days of transparency are but a faint memory. Following the resounding ‘once in a generation’ 2014 referendum defeat, what did the SNP do? They schemed: what would be the best way for us to make the numbers up and get Indy over the line? They landed on the quagmire of identity politics —\u0026nbsp; using people’s identities as political weapons — a foray that now threatens to destroy them.\u0026nbsp; This misguided attempt to pander to the ‘youth’ vote, despite numerous studies that prove they are far from a single voting block, has opened a deep schism within the SNP camp, as opposing identities fight it out. Although we can take some solace, because it tells us that there are still some people who can think inside the SNP.\u0026nbsp; While gender identification is a divisive topic, and one which I happily leave to individuals to decide, I fundamentally disagree with the toxic atmosphere that poisons the whole debate. We now live in a world where people are afraid to voice their opinions. Even someone like J.K. Rowling, who has brought magic to millions of people around the world, was lambasted for stating she believes that only biological women have periods. Many called for her ‘cancellation’. Activists seek to, by exaggerated and concurred social pressure, attempt to stifle all debate and disagreement, the very mentality which groups that struggle for rights and recognition have fought tirelessly against. While the SNP claim to give a voice to people, all they do is attempt to stifle the voices of others. The gender liberation struggles of the 1970s and 1980s aimed to open a discussion on what it is to be a woman or a man, not to close it down. Yet, today dialogue has been replaced by rhetoric, nuance replaced by extremism, and balance is replaced by brute force.\u0026nbsp; If, or should I say when, you dispute what you are told to believe, you will be isolated and labelled as an enemy of “progress” and you will be accused of spreading hatred toward trans-individuals or any other anointed group. What I fear, and what I always fight against, is the poisonous manner in which debates are conducted. The SNP’s zealotry is manifested in their totalitarian desire to claim a monopoly on what is morally right and wrong and to use that monopoly to exile all who question their beliefs.\u0026nbsp; Such is the treatment Joanna Cherry, an avowed feminist and lesbian received - even a death threat. It may seem strange receiving death threats from the supposed paragons of love and inclusivity, but then you are only supposed to accept and never question, the exact mentality the feminism of the 1970s fought so hard against. Cherry’s crime? To applaud an amendment to Humza Yousaf’s Hate Crime Bill that would allow open discussions of trans issues without it being classed as a hate crime. Imagine being able to discuss whether a man can be classed as a woman without the police being called? Amazing! Speaking in Westminster, Cherry said that, across society, people were losing their jobs and facing difficulties “simply for questioning the ideology that any man can self-identify as a woman”, prompting a rare agreement from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House of Commons, who said, “Much as I disagree with her on so many things, may I commend her courage in standing up for freedom of speech and putting forward her views clearly in a difficult and sensitive area but one where she has a right to be heard?”\u0026nbsp; In Scotland, Humza Yousaf’s ‘Hate Crime Bill’ is the battleground for this insanity. A bill that aims to police the very words we use, even over the dinner table. It ensures that any criticism is made unlawful by virtue of ‘the intention of stirring up hatred’, while those promoting questionable ideas are to become shielded from ridicule.\u0026nbsp; No-one is safe from this dogma. It aims to stifle debate through self-censorship. Who wants to be a victim of the state’s arbitrary power over thought and speech? Not to mention how any jury could peer into a person’s mind and determine their intentions. The SNP claims to be a party in search of what is ‘right’ but, in reality, they are a party in search of might, be that ideological, economic, social or cultural. To this end they will use whatever argument suits them, caring nothing for the freedoms which untold numbers of people fought and died for before them.\u0026nbsp; With their false claim on a monopoly on morality and personal opinion, they are following the well trodden trail of totalitarian ideologues that have brought untold suffering to our world. Far from advancing the rights and voices of people, they have silenced them under a barrage of rhetoric and threats to stifle any productive and inclusive debate. I know that writing this will open me up to all sorts of outlandish accusations, “why do you want to spread hate?” they will say as they plow on by without reading a word I have to say. I don’t want to spread hate, far from it. All I wish to do is live in a world where character and not superficial identity is the measure of a person.

On paper, the numbers seem impressive: according to the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) 2024–25 report, Scotland receives £2,669 more per person in public spending than the UK average. But in reality, this dividend is wasted as under the SNP, Scotland’s extra funding is being squandered on a bloated, inefficient, and politically motivated public sector, while schools, hospitals, and local services continue to decline. Ordinary Scots see none of the supposed benefit. (Note: It’s also time pro-UK politicians and commentators stopped calling the UK a ‘union’ of four countries’. The UK isn’t a union of four nation states; it\u0027s a single state that has devolved administrations. The union was a one-time event in 1707 that created a new single country. To keep calling it a ‘union of four countries’ plays into separatist rhetoric) Scotland’s Bloated Public Sector The Fraser of Allander Institute confirms the structural truth: Scotland’s £26 billion fiscal deficit is not a temporary problem — it is the result of a part of the UK under devolution that has grown too large to function effectively. Public sector staffing remains elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, and token cuts will not reverse this. The total wage bill for Scotland’s devolved public sector is approaching £30 billion, nearly 55% of the block grant from Westminster, and may rise to £32 billion by 2029–30. That is more than half of Scotland’s “Union dividend” being absorbed by salaries, pensions, and bureaucracy — money that could instead fund hospitals, schools, policing, and infrastructure. Scotland’s public sector is no longer a tool for delivering services; it has become an end in itself. The devolved administeation exists to sustain itself, expand its workforce, and fund politically convenient initiatives. Fiascos and Waste The SNP’s mismanagement is not abstract. It is visible in every corner of public spending: £350 million on ferries that still do not sail Prestwick Airport, which has devoured tens of millions with no recovery plan A sprawling network of quangos and advisory boards, many duplicating work, producing little value, and staffed with political appointees These are not isolated blunders. They are symptoms of a devolved administration addicted to expansion, bureaucracy, and political patronage, while frontline services collapse. Scotland spends more per head than the rest of the UK — and yet outcomes are worse: longer NHS waiting times, declining school standards, and local authorities warning of service failure. Why the “Union Dividend” Is a Hollow Promise under legislative devolution and the SNP A dividend is a reward for performance. Scotland’s “Union dividend” is the opposite: a subsidy for incompetence and mismanagement. Extra funding exists, but because the SNP prioritises bureaucracy and vanity projects over outcomes, ordinary Scots see no tangible benefit. Alleged pro-UK politicians continue to tout the extra funding as proof that Scotland prospers in the UK. But the reality is damning: the SNP ensures that the additional money is absorbed into the machinery of government, leaving citizens worse off despite higher per-capita spending. The Political Crisis Scotland’s failure is political. The extra money flowing from Westminster is real. But it is being squandered by the Scottish Executive (Holyrood), especially under the SNP, which has made a political choice to grow the public sector and fund projects with political rather than public utility. The Fraser of Allander Institute calls the deficit structural. Scotland spends faster than it earns. The devolved administration is simply too large to deliver the services people need. Ordinary Scots pay the price, while the SNP collects credit for what it does not achieve. The Way Forward: Reform or Abolish There is only one solution if Scotland is to benefit from its resources: cut the bloated public sector, eliminate waste, and hold quangos accountable. That means: Reining in staffing and wages in the devolved public sector Ending politically motivated vanity projects, like ferries that never sail and mismanaged airports Prioritising frontline services over bureaucracy Until that happens, the “Union dividend” will remain a subsidy for inefficiency rather than a reward for achievement. The evidence is unmistakable: Scotland gets more money, yet services decline. Scotland’s problem is political. The SNP’s addiction to expanding its administration and waste has turned extra funding into a liability rather than an asset. The sooner the bloated devolved administration is reined in — or preferably Holyrood abolished — the sooner Scotland can turn funding into results instead of perpetuating decline.

Perhaps this is why he is introducing a bitterly contested bill to ban and to criminalise ‘hate speech’, especially speech that is incitement to hatred, in people’s homes. There is also a convoluted plan to criminalise playwrights and perhaps also actors performing in plays where Mr Yousaf deems the text to be likely to incite hatred. The scriptwriter Jonny Speight would, no doubt, have been firmly in his sights for his creation, Alf Garnett, even though this character was a satirical construct. Of course no reasonable person wants to hear ‘hate speech’ in the public or private domains. But criminalising what is said in people’s homes is a step too far.\u0026nbsp; Mr Yousaf is, however, defending his law and denying the ‘free speech’ defence. I am not clear whether there is a watertight definition in this bill of what constitutes ‘hate speech’, but it appears to mean something that offends another person. I would be interested to know whether promoting the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, whose publishers have been lethally attacked for reproducing images of the prophet Mohammed, would count as ‘hate speech’ under this law. In a democratic polity, no-one has an inalienable right not to be offended. In a democratic polity, no-one has an inalienable right not to be offended. This bill has been criticised by organisations representing broad sections of society, including the Roman Catholic Church and the Secular Society, groups that would normally be on opposing sides of an issue. The Scottish Police Federation, too, opposes the bill. Its members would be in the front line of enforcing it, and that would be an uncomfortable place to be. There is little in the bill that is not already covered in existing legislation, apart from the intrusion into people’s homes. It is, of course, already permissible to arrest people for criminal acts at home, such as assault or downloading images of child sexual abuse. But the criminalisation of speech in the home is another matter. It goes beyond the ill-conceived and now repealed Offensive Behaviour at Football Act, and it returns us to some of the kinds of argument that bedevilled the SNP’s attempt to impose a Named Person on every child – another intrusion into family life. Quite how Yousaf intends to police conversations in the home is not vouchsafed to us. Perhaps family members and guests are to be interrogated about what they have discussed in random checks of households. Or perhaps there will be particular attention paid to the households of those suspected of having views that do not accord with the world view of the regime in power. It would be difficult, at first at least, to have the kind of surveillance that used to happen in Soviet eastern Europe.\u0026nbsp; When Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright and later first President of post-Soviet Czechoslovakia was persona non grata in the 1970s under the Husak communist regime, he was either imprisoned or, when at liberty, constantly followed and harassed by not very secret agents of the secret police. In the former German Democratic Republic, about one person in fifty was an agent of the Stasi, the secret police. Dissidents were under surveillance, sometimes by long lens cameras set up in a flat opposite their own. The paranoia of that surveillance society is expertly depicted in the 2007 film, \"The Lives Of Others\". The monstrous extent of Stasi monitoring of the East German public became known only after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. They even had a collection of sealed jars containing dusters that had wiped the seats used by subjects of interrogation, to be produced for sniffer dogs to identify or track down these subjects subsequently. This Scottish legislation is, however, incongruous given Mr Yousaf’s own record and that of his party and its supporters. He is the man who stood in the Scottish parliament this year and accused Scotland of having ‘a problem with structural racism’. He complained about there having been only four MSPs from a minority ethnic background out of some 300 who have sat at Holyrood.\u0026nbsp; Yet that is not disproportionate when 96 per cent of Scots are white – something he omitted to mention as he kept spitting out the word ‘white’ in the chamber, as if it were a swear word. His diatribe was ripe for satire, with the alternative version showing him complaining about the white cross on the saltire and the SNP’s White Paper of 2013. But perhaps that satire, too, would be classed as ‘hate speech’ in our brave new Scotland.\u0026nbsp; The hate speech that is most evident in Scotland is that directed by supporters of Mr Yousaf’s own party, the SNP, at those who disagree with it about Scotland’s future. How would he deal with the author of this tweet from 3 April 2017: Unionist supporters who would still vote no in a Scottish independence referendum should be gassed like Jews #Referendum #ScotRef Many are more on the level of the tweet by the journalist, Ruth Wishart – deeply unpleasant and plain wrong, but not violent: https://twitter.com/ruth_wishart/status/1297777980748566532 Further tweets demonstrate nationalists’ cavalier attitude to freedom of opinion. From 16 June 2020: On the same day, there was also this: If Mr Yousaf wants to criminalise ‘hatred’, we are on a steep and slippery slope into legalised intolerance. Hatred can derive from ignorance, bigotry, misinformation. It can, as I have shown, be exemplified in different ways. It can be ugly and disfiguring. Incitement to hatred can be ugly and frightening. But should hatred itself be criminalised?\u0026nbsp; Incitement to violence should probably be subject to legal sanctions. But Mr Yousaf should be aware that if incitement to hatred itself is criminalised, he could end up with large numbers of Scottish nationalists in the courts.

That tower reminds me of the current SNP, as Nicola Sturgeon and her cronies pull the blocks out from under themselves. In a recent contribution to the Spectator it was noted that, despite the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s woeful handling of a myriad of domestic issues, she and her party remain popular amongst Scottish voters, seemingly defying electoral and political gravity. It is expected that a party— any party— after 13 and half years in power, would see their voters trickle away, as scandals build, the party runs out of ideas, their policies fall flat, and its politicians become stale. Surely, this should be the case with the SNP, a party that has overseen\u0026nbsp;financial and business collapses,\u0026nbsp;the worst drugs death rates in Europe,\u0026nbsp;high-level political infighting, publicity gaffes, and over 200 scandals of all kinds.\u0026nbsp; Even members of the party are now saying they are increasingly looking like a party which\u0026nbsp;needs time in opposition,\u0026nbsp;as they have run out of ideas.\u0026nbsp; Surely then, political gravity must take its course. However, it won\u0027t -- at least not in the way that we know it. The political gravity we are used to only applies to conventional politicians with conventional parties, standard policies, and above all, achievable objectives that they have failed to meet.\u0026nbsp; The SNP is not conventional; its policies — the limited domestic ones they have at least —\u0026nbsp; are outlandish and often appalling. Their politicians rely on feelings, not figures, as the measure of their success. Fundamentally, their main political objective, Separation, is abstract, to be worked towards, not something that can be measured. When they don\u0027t achieve their goal of Separation, they are not judged as a failure for not having carried out their promises. Instead, their voters only support them further.\u0026nbsp; Nicola Sturgeon and her party are populists and the conventional rules of politics do not apply to populists. These times of extraordinary social and political upheaval allow her to provide ready answers to absolve herself. Business is not performing; she blames Brexit. Healthcare is collapsing; she blames the pandemic.\u0026nbsp;For all ills, she blames Westminster. As populists, the SNP will play any tune they think the voters want to hear. Instead of conventional party politics, we see a mishmash of conflicting policies that are promoted for style over substance.\u0026nbsp; So, how do we deal with a populist who is seemingly immune from political gravity? Well, that is simpler than it may appear: the cracks are already there. The fate of her party and their objectives is inexorably connected to her ability to be seen to be trustworthy in the eyes of the electorate.\u0026nbsp; Already, she is taking a hit from the Salmond inquiry, Bi-Fab, the ferry scandal and the worst drug death rate in Europe, all of which, bit by bit, chip away at the visage of trust. The tower still seems stable, but the blocks are being pulled. The Salmond Inquiry, Hate Speech Act, and the Gender Recognition Act, are alienating her base. With Bi-Fab and the ferries, she has eroded the trust of the unions and heavy industry. They have chosen to back Labour, rather than the SNP, on the constitutional issue. Thirteen years of failure on education, healthcare and social issues is losing the centre. These forces will all combine into an unstoppable political gravity, which would pull any politician, even one like Sturgeon with high-flying favourability, towards their earthly demise. What the SNP fear above all, is a loss of a symbolic enemy, and that is precisely what is about to happen. The most recent poll conducted by the Scotsman had\u0026nbsp;secession support at 52% (excluding Don’t Knows) and was taken at a time when a no-deal Brexit seemed most likely, and even unavoidable.\u0026nbsp; However, this is no longer the case, and should a Brexit deal occur, it would deprive Sturgeon of a vital source of deflection and grievance. Now, due to the pandemic, the economic impact of Brexit will not be visible to the average voter. With a loss of one popular scapegoat, she is vulnerable; two could well prove fatal.\u0026nbsp; Labour under Sir Keir Starmer, we are told, is under \"new leadership\", and he is well-liked as a political figure in Scotland. Even Scottish Labour is, slowly, climbing up the polls and is currently around 20%. A few more points, a few more speeches and appearances and a honing of messaging, and Nicola will start to enter dire straits indeed.\u0026nbsp; Labour and the Conservatives only need to increase their vote by 2.5% each, providing Liberal Democrat support holds at 6%, and the SNP will be denied the supposed mandate they so desperately seek.\u0026nbsp; The search for stability after COVID and Brexit will be great and SNP members will need trust in their leadership and party. Sturgeon has led her party up the indy hill many times, and the troops are beginning to falter, despite the supposedly encouraging polling. Trust is the be-all and end-all to the SNP. Should they lose any of that trust, gravity will resume, and the earth will close in on them fast, and with an almighty thump. The tower is set, the blocks are being continually pulled away. The members atop it fear the collapse, so they fight like dogs to keep the public from seeing it disintegrate. But once the gaps become too numerous, and the structure too rickety, even the strongest tower crumbles to rubble in seconds, pulling all those atop it down with them.\u0026nbsp;","date":"2020-12-20","summary":"I used to play Jenga as a child, and I have always remembered how often the most stable-looking tower would crumble, when a single, seemingly unimport..."},{"title":"Three reasons Reform UK Scotland will fail","url":"/articles/three-reasons-reform-uk-scotland-will-fail/","content":"The launch of a new political party can be explosive. When viewed with hindsight, such events can be seen to have defined a political era. The 1981 launch of the SDP, for example, represents a time when the UK electorate sought a halfway house between merciless Thatcherite market reform and stubborn, electorally toxic hard-left Labour ideology. That said, the launch this week of Reform UK Scotland is unlikely to take up more than a couple of lines in the annals of Scotland’s political history. Its leader, former Conservative MSP for the South Scotland region Michelle Ballantyne, is altogether more interesting than her new party. When appointed Social Security spokesperson by Ruth Davidson, Ballantyne was widely criticised for speaking out on the issue of jobless parents’ right to raise children, saying: People on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and don\u0027t claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have. When Davidson stepped down, Ballantyne contested the Scottish Conservative party leadership election in 2020, losing to Jackson Carlaw, who stood her down from his shadow team. In January last year, she criticised Carlaw’s failure to win more seats in the 2019 General Election: We had the right candidates but our party in Scotland lacked vision and ambition. Carlaw responded: In all the time that she’s been in the shadow cabinet, Michelle is the only member of it never to have brought forward a single policy proposal or to table a single policy paper. I find that curious. When Carlaw stepped down, she railed against what she saw as the coronation of of Douglas Ross, offering her conditional support: I have spoken with key people (not MSPs!) about what is happening and I am now content to back Douglas. This is on the understanding that we will be a centre right Conservative, Boris backing, Brexit positive, anti-nat party. But after Ross claimed that Brexit was \u0027damaging\u0027 and directed his MSPs to support SNP lockdowns (only Ballantine and Oliver Mundell voted against), it seems Ms Ballantyne had had enough and stood down from the party, saying that Scottish Conservatives were “no longer a good fit”. Fast forward seven weeks, and Ms Ballantyne is back in the limelight at the (regional) helm of her new party. A party, we are told by Michelle, that is “simply the best choice for the people of these islands”. One stated Reform UK policy is a mandate to argue against lockdowns, which is unlikely to be uppermost in voters’ minds, as the daily Covid-19 death toll exceeds 1,500. Ill-considered policies aside, there are three reasons why the creation of Reform UK Scotland is unlikely to see panic set in at Bute House any time soon. Firstly, swapping parties is rarely a precursor to electoral success. The plain fact is, UK voters are habitually suspicious of defectors. When a candidate is elected to sit in Parliament for a political party, voters tend to take a rather dim view when their chosen representative cannot suppress the urge to find a better fitting collective. Secondly, the leadership. The even more plain fact is Nigel Farage does not, and never will, resonate with Scottish voters. While Ms Ballantyne is unlikely to be forced by an angry mob to seek refuge in a Dumfries coffee house, her new boss will continue to be unwelcome. Mr Farage has undoubted appeal to a certain demographic. The bad news for the “architect of Brexit” is that demographic doesn’t break cover north of Ecclefechan. Thirdly, as we have seen this week, branch offices of London-based political parties are not popular in Scotland. When Richard Leonard’s replacement is announced, the Scottish Labour and Conservative parties will both have appointed three new leaders during this Holyrood term. Again, those pesky Scottish voters do not appreciate the supposed leaders of their political parties taking their cues from UK party bosses. Invariably, these “regional office” leadership roles are not made to last.\u0026nbsp; Ruth Davidson found the prospect of working for Boris Johnson unpalatable and quit. Jackson Carlaw was simply too decent to counter Nicola Sturgeon’s sneers. Douglas Ross is talented but he seems happiest when running the line at an SPL football match. And the question has yet to be asked to which the answer was Richard Leonard. Can Michelle Ballantyne break the cycle and deliver Scottish votes by the barrowload to Nigel Farage? Don’t put next month’s furlough paycheck on it. An accusation that is sometimes, rather unkindly, levelled at Scotland, is that there is something of a limited talent pool. The same names and faces keep appearing, is the cry. The Scottish political scene is no different. The Holyrood opposition parties cannot muster up a single MSP, the outgoing Ms Davidson notwithstanding, to land a meaningful blow on the most dismal administration in its short and undistinguished history.\u0026nbsp; The SNP’s record in office is unquestionably deplorable. New depths of sheer incompetence are plumbed every day by Scotland’s party of government, which is meanwhile tearing itself apart with factional disputes, a hamstrung inquiry into the botched Salmond sexual misconduct investigation and the inability to take one meaningful step closer to the delivery of a second referendum.\u0026nbsp; Despite this lamentable list of SNP failures, Scotland lacks a credible Holyrood Opposition. Every day, the same faces plod wearily through their interminable rituals as they await the blessed relief of electoral defeat in May. The public has seen enough. Change must come. Scottish politics desperately needs an infusion of new blood. It doesn’t, however, need Nigel Farage in this year’s costume and it doesn’t need Reform UK Scotland. Neither does Michelle Ballantyne.

Fire is fought with fire; power with power. But Douglas Ross decided, in supreme arrogance, that his puny media presence was enough to cut through to voters.\u0026nbsp; Desperate not to be seen as a ‘branch office’ by the SNP, Ross and his team made the decision to keep Boris (the vote winner) and other senior Conservatives out of Scotland. In wanting to distance themselves from Westminster, The Scottish Tories distanced themselves from winning.\u0026nbsp; The truth is that, outside of Ross’s circle of weak-chinned senior Tories, Scottish Tory voters LIKE Boris. They like him because, to them, he’s a winner. He delivered Brexit and he delivered a successful vaccine rollout. But you wouldn\u0027t know that from Ross. Like most senior Scottish Tories, he’s a Remainer, closer to a LibDem than a Tory, so he never mentions Brexit positively, and I can’t recall him talking about the vaccine rollout. And even if he did, it wasn’t his success. However, it WAS Boris’s success and a UK success to boot, when compared to Europe’s failing rollout. But Ross didn’t let Boris talk about the vaccine, or Rishi Sunak talk about the billions of COVID funds or how the UK funds Scotland’s deficit. He didn’t bring Michael Gove up to talk about upcoming UK projects and jobs that will benefit Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Imagine, every few days, a new, provocative statement from the UK team, LEADING the media. Instead we had wee Dougie, playing second fiddle to Sturgeon, every time. 2. Not deploying tactical voting The opposition parties had five years to make a tactical voting plan and failed. Some commentators have said, ‘But Ross offered Labour a deal, and they refused’. So let me say, ‘A deal isn’t a deal until it is made’. I can offer Angelina Jolie a great night out in Glasgow, but until she agrees I’ve got nothing. We should all be especially wary of offers made in public. Delicate negotiations are not done through public pronouncements. So, in the end there was no pact, not even on the minimum number of seats. Couldn’t the parties have had the mental flexibility to make a one-time agreement on a few seats to break the back of the SNP for good? That would have been ten seats the SNP could have lost. Or at least feared losing. In the end, the Tories lost Ayr by 170 VOTES! And lost Edinburgh Central (not helped by running a nobody with zero social media presence). Due to split votes, seats like East Lothian; Aberdeen South \u0026amp; Kincardine North; Perthshire South \u0026amp; Kinross-shire; Hamilton, Larkhall \u0026amp; Stonehouse; Aberdeenshire East and Banffshire \u0026amp; Buchan Coast were all lost. I don’t get the logic that says ‘The SNP will criticise us if we form a pact’. The SNP will criticise you whatever you do. Meanwhile, you’ve won, you’re in power and can get on with fixing the mess they’ve made.\u0026nbsp; Then to cap it all, the day before the election, Ross had the cheek to boast that Labour voters were tactically voting for the Tories. Not only was that counter productive, it wasn’t even his initiative. Utterly shameless. *** Part of the blame for this has to go to Scottish Labour, a party that is so cowed by fear of being called Red Tories that it won’t make a pact with the Tories to win. Sure, some Labour voters will never vote Tory under any circumstances, but enough are persuadable to make a difference in key seats so they can win and get into power, especially if the leadership educated them. Sarwar’s strategy to woo back soft-Nationalists, based on being an alternative to the SNP’s poor governance, could maybe have worked in better times. But there wasn’t time for that. It’s not enough to be seen as a nice guy. You have to be an effective nice guy. Instead of winning multiple seats with a pact, Labour almost lost Jackie Baillie’s constituency. A seat that was only won because ordinary Tory voters decided to vote tactically for Labour. Don’t you think Sarwar could acknowledge this and repay the favour sometime? It could have been worse. Sarwar seemed to want to deliberately antagonise the Tories who were considering tactically voting for him. Unnecessary anti-Tory comments showed an immaturity and inflexibility, where nuance and flexibility would have won the day. 3. Making the election into a referendum As we all know, Separation is way down the list of voters’ priorities, so why did Ross talk endlessly about it? Even Sturgeon didn’t want to talk about it. She was only forced to talk about it by Alex Salmond nipping at her heels. Sarwar had the correct idea; talk about ANYTHING ELSE. But Ross could have gone one further he could have talked about ANYTHING ELSE while saying THEY DON’T HAVE THE POWER. The law and public sentiment is quite clear. There can be no referendum. Let’s talk about real issues. It’s not as though there isn’t material to work with. 14 years of failure (soon to be updated to 15, 16, 17 and 18 years of failure), 200 scandals, an untrustworthy First Minister and a party in civil war. For the love of God, what more do you need? But did Ross break through on any of this, or JOBS or RECOVERY or ECONOMY? Did he talk about what would happen after the pandemic? Did he get Boris or Sunak or Gove or other heavy hitters to talk about what would happen after the pandemic? Caught in his own trap, he couldn’t even answer the most basic questions about the constitution: Is this a voluntary Union? (No, because the UK isn’t a union). Or on whether the SNP have a mandate? https://twitter.com/STVNews/status/1390747791102709761 Frankly, that was embarrassing. All he needed to say at all times was:\u0026nbsp; Why are we talking about this? This election is for a devolved Scottish government, whose purpose is to improve the lives of Scots. We will provide XXX number of vaccines, XXX number of jobs and stability. If Ross had done this, he and Sarwar could have placed the main parties as those talking about the issues people actually care about, while Sturgeon was forced to talk about the referendum by Alex Salmond. Instead Ross did Salmond’s job.\u0026nbsp; 4. Guaranteeing a referendum But, in a fit of insanity, Ross went beyond setting the Tories up to be the party that would not only stop a referendum that the SNP have no power to hold, but said that if Nationalists got a majority, it would guarantee a referendum. And oh, how close we came. He gambled unnecessarily and we nearly lost. https://twitter.com/ScotTories/status/1389220146632437763 This instantly angered and demoralised anti-Nationalists, while energising Nationalists, who were now given a target to work to. There were hundreds of tweets like these: https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1389232691032244233 \u0026nbsp;And this from Humza Yousaf: https://twitter.com/HumzaYousaf/status/1389296404468752385 Many people begged the Tory social media team to take this post down. But they doubled down, claiming that they would stop the SNP holding a wildcat referendum. A wildcat referendum that would be illegal anyway, so you wouldn’t even need to vote Tory to stop it.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/ScotTories/status/1389258846552707073 Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired, and if it was you Mr Ross, you should go. The person who did this put the UK on a knife edge completely unnecessarily. I wonder if this policy was talked through with the UK party. If not, why not, and if it was agreed as a strategy, then whoever signed off on it should be fired or step down too. https://twitter.com/themajorityscot/status/1389241462236270599 As it was, through tactical voting, the SNP narrowly missed their majority BY ONE SEAT. A few more seats and we’d now be in the situation where the SNP would be backing up their demands for a referendum with Ross’s promise. You can be guaranteed they’ll use it anyway. So, Mr Ross, stop enabling Nationalists. All you ever had to say was: even if they get a majority, breaking up the UK is a matter reserved to the UK Government. 5. Weak and insipid marketing\u0026nbsp; I have seldom seen a marketing campaign for any product that had so little imagination, not to mention coverage. In Glasgow, I saw SNP, Labour, LibDem, Green and All for Unity billboards. I saw ones from The National and from Scottish Business UK. While Scotland Matters put out incredible cartoon billboards, and we were pushing tactical voting and 14 YEARS OF FAILURE billboards, ad vans and even a #ResignSturgeon banner flying over Holyrood, I didn’t see a single Tory billboard. Why was it left to our donors — ordinary people —\u0026nbsp; to do the job that the Tory party wouldn’t do? Beyond billboards, I didn’t see any social media ads. I didn’t see any single, strong consistent message. The only outdoor media I saw was the crappy A-frame in the ‘guaranteed referendum’ tweet, that said HOW TO STOP INDY and #Peach votes Tory.\u0026nbsp; Peach votes Tory. Was that the best you could come up with? Do you think so little of the public that you won’t even try to reach out to them with a decent message. I did see a wrecking ball post on social media. Here\u0027s how it was reported: The Scottish Tories have accused the SNP of seeking to take a \"wrecking ball\" to Scotland\u0027s recovery by holding another referendum.\u0026nbsp; There we go again. Note that the message isn’t: \u0027Tories gave you a vaccine and will lead the recovery\u0027. It’s \u0027stop their referendum\u0027. The SNP have no power to call a referendum. Stop enabling them. A special mention must be made for Scottish Labour’s \u0027Vote for a better opposition\u0027 campaign. Sure, vote for us to get second place! No thanks, says the man in the street, I’d rather vote for a winner.\u0026nbsp; Marketing is about creating a winning image. Telling people you’re going to be second is obviously a losing proposition. Vote for us, we’re not as good as the other guys. Instead you should be telling people that you\u0027re the winner. Fake it ‘til you make it. *** Taken all together, these points can be condensed into a single theme: The opposition, and in particular, the Scottish Tories, are always fighting the SNP on the SNP\u0027s terms: They call you a branch office: So you don’t deploy UK resources. In fact, you criticise the UK party. They win.They call Boris bad. They make you ashamed of him. You don’t deploy him. Your base is demoralised. You don’t get on the TV. They win.They want a referendum, so you talk about that, instead of 14 years of failure. They win.They’ll criticise you if you make a pact. So you don’t make a pact. They win.They criticise you if you ‘talk down Scotland’. So you talk about Four Nations and The Union. They win.They call it \u0027independence\u0027. But it’s actually \u0027separation\u0027 and \u0027breaking up the UK\u0027. Yet, you still use their words. You call it \u0027independence\u0027. They win. The pattern is clear. They\u0027re so scared of SNP criticism, they keep doing the things the SNP want them to do, in the language the SNP want them to use. That’s not leadership, it’s capitulation.\u0026nbsp; Nothing will change until tthe Scottish Tory Party changes the narrative; until they realise that it has the moral, political, legal, cultural and media power to dictate terms to a minority of separatists, not the other way around. You can never win when you play by Separatist rules. Wake up and start winning and if you can’t, disband, because the Black Knights of the Scottish Tories are not just scratched. they\u0027re bleeding out.

Men who had been venerated in their time were now exposed as having profited from slavery or other ignominious acts. What was surprising was how quickly it all happened. One day nobody cared; the next statues were being pulled down. How quickly times change. The esteemed German sociologist Max Weber says leaders, in the past or today, derive their authority from three different sources: legal authority, traditional authority, and charismatic authority.\u0026nbsp; Legal authority is a system of ruling in which the power of the individual comes from a legal framework, for example when Joe Biden was inaugurated he was transferred the powers of the presidency under the authority of The Constitution of the United States of America which is the foundational document of their nation.\u0026nbsp; Traditional authority is a power that derives from custom and tradition, for example, that of kings and queens, even if they are also now contained within a legal framework.\u0026nbsp; Charismatic authority doesn\u0027t come from a legal document or centuries of tradition but from a single person and simply means that the individual has a charismatic ability to inspire people, through their speeches, actions, ideas or mere presence, to trust and follow them and their ideologies.\u0026nbsp; It does not refer in any way to the morality of the actions but only their leadership style. It\u0027s a very broad category; there are many kinds of charismatic individuals, such as religious leaders, political figures, celebrities, sports stars or even people who come to symbolise their movement.\u0026nbsp; Nationalism is a centralising ideology. When everything is seen through the lens of ‘the nation’, power and authority inevitably become over-concentrated in the nation’s living embodiment, its Dear Leader. But, the control and stability of any movement lasts only as long as that leader inspires trust in their followers. Should they fail, then their movement collapses.\u0026nbsp; And now we come to Scotland, the inquiry into the Scottish Government’s botched Alex Salmond harassment claims and Nicola Sturgeon. Nicola Sturgeon is a\u0026nbsp;vital asset to the SNP. No-one could ever hope to replace her and maintain her level of support. Credit where credit is due, she is a skilled, if limited, politician and has become a good communicator. She knows how to play a situation to her advantage. She is undoubtedly a charismatic authority figure, but while she built the SNP into what we see today, it survives only as long as she remains at the helm, untarnished and trusted.\u0026nbsp; Throughout this whole sorry saga of the Salmond inquiry, we have seen intentional and outrageous contempt for the commission\u0027s investigative mandate and shameless treatment of the Scottish public and its elected officials. We have seen the SNP pull out every possible excuse to delay and disrupt the inquiry to the point that the inquiry has been forced to invoke powers never used before by the Scottish parliament. As one SNP MP put it, it\u0027s difficult to imagine this happening at Westminster without the whole country going berserk about it.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/AngusMacNeilSNP/status/1352192148515532800 It seems, however, that things are changing. Inquiry members are becoming more forceful in their demands. The press is finally paying attention as more and more shocking revelations are made. The old adage of \"if it bleeds, it leads\" will mean ever more lurid headlines as the knives are plunged further in. So why, you may ask, is the SNP tarnishing its reputation with such actions? The answer is simple. Nicola Sturgeon is their charismatic leader. She, not them, is the good communicator, the trusted figure, and the one who has been on their screens for the past nine months. It is she who has come to represent their movement and their ideas. It is she who inspires her followers to trust her. It\u0027s her public personality that represents the SNP, and no one else can come close.\u0026nbsp; Charismatic authority and leadership are strong forces, but their fundamental weakness is their reliance on a single individual who, when removed by circumstance or by treachery, results in the entire movement\u0027s collapse.\u0026nbsp; If (or, more likely, when) the SNP lose Nicola Sturgeon to scandal, the entire movement will be holed deep below the waterline. All the people she has recently led to the party will no longer have a reason to stay.\u0026nbsp; With no new charismatic leader, there will not only be a leadership vacuum, there will be a moral vacuum as party members and the public demand to know what else has been lied about, who else knew of this scandal and who helped cover it up? With their leader out of the way, the party’s abysmal record in government will lie exposed.\u0026nbsp; To save themselves, the SNP are pushing as hard as they can to stop Nicola Sturgeon’s statue falling. But the weight of scandal is too heavy. Gravity is insistent. Like the idols of the past, St Nicola will fall too, and everything she’s touched will come crashing down with her.\u0026nbsp; Angus Robinson is a lecturer at a UK university.

If they resisted, they would be punished with eternal damnation for questioning the will of God. Countless suffered and died under this theocracy, waiting for a salvation that never came.\u0026nbsp; Marx was right in many of his sociological observations, but he missed that any aspirational and transcendent ideology could be used in such a manner. His own ideology would be hijacked, and millions more would die, struggling in vain for a communist utopia that also never came to pass.\u0026nbsp; Today, we see how secessionism has become the new opiate of the Scottish people. How they too endure horrifying conditions and social injustice and how those who dare to question the theocracy are set upon as heretics. The independence movement is both theocracy and cult. Like all cults, predictions of judgement day are made, and then pass. Yet, the faithful continue to believe in their leaders when they predict yet another doomsday. Reality never gets in the way, And as with all cults, adherence swells in times of great uncertainty, like the ones we are in now.\u0026nbsp; What brought home to me that the Nationalist movement is functionally little more than a new religion was this tweet. It promises everything from a better NHS to a Scottish pound that is stronger than the Pound Sterling, cheaper food and fuel, and a more tolerant society. All promises made by people who cannot guarantee them and who, frankly, have no interest in delivering them. They only need people to believe them. These promises, shared by the faithful, serve only to indoctrinate believers and are products of the same arrogant cynicism and blind fundamentalism that the priests and kings of old once peddled to the suffering serfs and plagued peasants.\u0026nbsp; They had no control over them, and no need for them, after death. They only used such narratives to dupe and control them while they were alive and toiling.\u0026nbsp; These memes, like the countless graphs, arguments and images pushed by true believers to us unbelievers, remind me of another exercise in mass collective dissonance: Scientific Creationism, sometimes known as Intelligent Design, a pseudo-science that some high-profile adherents of the new Scottish theocracy also believe in. The study of Scientific Creationism, with its academic journals, lecturers, university courses, textbooks and even museums, is all aimed at proving something that the scientific consensus has long since abandoned as patently wrong. No, Adam and Eve did not have a pet dinosaur. This unscientific community publishes endless material, demands that \"missing links\" are filled, asks their opponents to prove negatives, disavows presented facts as biased or fabricated and, above all, constructs their investigative paradigm around faith rather than evidence. They aim to strengthen the opiate of the people.\u0026nbsp; Debates surrounding Scottish secession have that same level of cognitive dissonance and rejection of fact. The Separatist faithful also publish endless supposed \"truths\" and faith-led propaganda. And it’s just as bunk. They have pinned all that they are, their very identity, to the causes of secession and must, therefore try and convince us to join their cause. Rather than face reality, they create the facts to suit the utopia they desire. A utopia that, I hope for their sake, they know cannot be real.\u0026nbsp; A prime example is the so-called “GERS deniers”, who deny the Scottish government\u0027s own financial reporting and seek to dismiss its veracity. It doesn’t matter that these figures are compiled by the Scottish Government and acknowledged by Nicola Sturgeon and her finance ministers as correct — the facts don’t suit their narrative and must be denied, dismissed and denounced. Secession has become the newly established religion of Scotland. The great thinkers that were once the pride of Scotland have been abandoned in favour of flawed reasoning, false equivalence and stringent orthodoxy.\u0026nbsp; When I see their memes, graphs and slogans, I cannot but think of those who try to tell me that the Earth is only 6000 years old. As our population, and our future, suffer the delusions of these new Scottish Creationists, and are sedated by the opiate of secessionism, I finally understand the frustration which Marx must have felt.","date":"2020-11-27","summary":"Karl Marx famously stated that \"religion is the opiate of the people\", claiming that the ruling elite used religion to subdue the proletariat into acc..."},{"title":"Useful Idiots","url":"/articles/useful-idiots/","content":"In politics, the end always justifies the means. People are nothing but tools to advance causes and ideologies. Due to this inevitable fact, political history is littered with \"useful idiots\", people who champion and support a cause without knowing the full story behind it. Scottish politics is no exception, and has more useful idiots than many other places. The EU used the SNP during the Brexit negotiations to leverage the British government. When they were no longer needed, the SNP found themselves abandoned by an organisation that now says Scotland cannot join the Erasmus scheme because it is \"not a country\". The SNP were the EU’s useful idiots. The SNP were also used by the Catalan secessionists who fled their country after their abortive illegal referendum. They now hang around Scotland like the Russian nobility after the revolution. The SNP seemed oblivious to the fact that housing individuals who intended on breaking up an EU member state will not bode well for them if they ever try to join the EU. The SNP were the Catalans\u0027 useful idiots. It goes both ways. The SNP, and assorted secessionists, have often relied on useful idiots to further their cause, in many cases extraordinarily idiotic useful idiots. The SNP uses the supposedly separate Green Party to stay in power. The Greens seem perfectly happy to go along with this, despite the SNP\u0027s plans to power a separated Scotland on gas and oil, while also repeatedly missing environmental targets. Not very green. The Greens are the SNP’s useful idiots. The SNP promise help for companies in the form of bailouts and incentives for hare-brained schemes that go nowhere, all so they can take a few photos and rack up press releases. It doesn\u0027t matter to the SNP that the project will fall through, people will lose their jobs, and whole regions will suffer. They get what they want and to hell with everyone else. These companies are the SNP’s useful idiots.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Out of all the myriad of useful idiots the SNP relies on for defence are the assorted embittered faux intellectuals that desperately desire to be Scandinavian, in style but not substance, and who cringe at anything that breaks their fantasy.\u0026nbsp; I know this type well because I spent many years with them. I did my undergraduate degree at Oxford University and still find myself there on occasion; it has become the Mecca of useful idiots. These people rail against the \"elite\", despite having lived their whole lives in the leafy affluent suburbs of North Oxford, where a single house sells for well over a million pounds. They clamour for revolution and change, identifying targets and enemies of the people and falling for any cause, no matter how outlandish or misunderstood.\u0026nbsp; These people, who spend their days cycling from one hipster coffee shop to another, who patronise pretentious art galleries set up by bored middle-aged washouts and who adore to \"raise awareness\" on all the ills of the world on a 1500-pound laptop they bought to edit their black and white photos of bridges. These are the champagne socialists who would clamour for the guillotine without knowing they were its next victims. They are the favourite target of the SNP. These people endlessly decry the nationalism of Brexit but unquestionably support the nationalism of the SNP. In Scotland, the SNP have learned to feed people a steady diet of opiates composed of impossible promises and poisonous xenophobic rhetoric to rally them to their support, despite the inescapable fact that those same people would be hardest hit by separation. In England, this does not cut it, too removed are they to understand and sympathise with this language, and so the SNP talk up their baby boxes, social policies and \"progressive\" ideology in an attempt to lure them in, either to support them or merely not question them. Thus we see, almost daily, Nicola Sturgeon being used by the English left-wing and media, completely ignoring her failings here in Scotland, so long as she can be used as a weapon to bash the UK Government. Of course, anyone who knows how these opportunist populists work can see their scams from a mile off, despite the heavy fog they emit, but then such people are not the useful idiots the SNP desire. Instead, they are the people who the SNP wishes to use these useful idiots against. The SNP are in a death spiral. Support for separation is dropping; their corruption is being called out left and right. They are mired in a civil war that makes Gettysburg look like a picnic. Their flimsy legal defences are collapsing, unleashing people who are hell bent on vengeance. The press, angered by the cutting of vital support, is no longer blind to their goings-on. Nationalist authors are turning against them, and influential figures within their party are calling for a coup. Yet some useful idiots persist. They claim all is well while the rubble falls around them. But we’re not listening any more. They might have been useful idiots to the SNP, but now they’re exposed as simply idiots to everyone else. What will become of them when the crash comes? Like all lost souls, abandoned and alone, they will wander in the wilderness, forever in search of their next futile cause.

The headline result of the poll was that there was a 50-50 split in support for the question ‘Should Scotland be an independent country’. In fact, the results were: Yes: 46%\u0026nbsp; No: 46%\u0026nbsp; Don’t Know 8% While I’m sure many of you will take issue with the question wording, the fun starts when the following question is asked: Please consider the following hypothetical scenario: the SNP issue a legally-binding commitment that in the event of a YES vote for Scottish independence, they will permanently disband the party and step down from government as soon as independence negotiations are concluded. In that event, how do you think you would vote in an independence referendum? In other words, if ‘independence’ would guarantee the end of the SNP, how would you vote for independence. The result for voters of any party was: Yes: 36%\u0026nbsp; No: 40%\u0026nbsp; Don’t Know 24% Support for independence drops by 14 percentage points if the SNP would disband. Excluding Don’t Knows, No leads by 53% to 47%. And note that Don’t Knows have risen from 8% to 24%. Now, let’s concentrate on SNP voters only. When they were asked ‘Should Scotland be an independent country?’ the results were high, as expected: Yes: 82%\u0026nbsp; No: 9%\u0026nbsp; Don’t Know: 8% But, when asked if their vote would guarantee the end of the SNP, their enthusiasm for independence wanes: Yes: 59%\u0026nbsp; No: 15%\u0026nbsp; Don’t Know: 27% As Wings confirms, ‘The number of SNP voters who’d be willing to sacrifice the party’s own power in the name of independence drops 23 percentage points, from 82% to just 59%.’ What does this mean?\u0026nbsp; As we all know, the SNP is primarily a massive anti-Tory protest vote. Hardcore Nationalists want to live in a fantasy country that has no Tories in it. A country where every child’s scary bedtime story is Maggie Thatcher the Milk Snatcher. Being ‘a Toarie’ is the very worst thing a Nationalist can imagine. They even labelled Labour voters as Red Tories as the ultimate insult (and to mask their own fake socialism, but more on that in a later article). But, in an independent country, this cannot last.\u0026nbsp; An independent Scotland has a choice: a one-party state or a two-party system. Certainly, given the centralisation and anti-democratic instinct of Nationalist parties worldwide, and here in Scotland, the former is a possibility. And if you want to present that to the voters, feel free to give it a try. But, let’s be generous and say that a two-party system would develop. With the independence issue resolved, political gravity will resume, protesters will return to their rightful homes, and balance will inevitably return to ‘normal’ party politics, with left-wing voters against right-wing voters.\u0026nbsp; And sometimes the right wing will win. It’s a myth to think of Scotland as a left-wing country. Up to the 1960s, Scotland voted for Tory governments. Indeed, in the 2019 General Election, just under 700,000 Scots voted for the Conservatives (one in four voters), and anti-Nationalist parties took 54% of votes cast, a majority of voters in Scotland.\u0026nbsp; Social attitude studies consistently show that attitudes to immigration and a host of other political issues — the ones that people actually care about — other than independence, are little different between Scotland and the rest of the UK. This means that, inevitably, the Tories or, more likely, a rebranded party of the right, would come to power in Scotland, and control all of the elements of power that the SNP currently have full control over through devolution:\u0026nbsp; A health service controlled by Tories. Social services run by Tories. Education run by Tories. The economy run by Tories. A police force run by Tories. Well, they voted for it! Nationalists like to say that they don’t care who is in power after independence. ‘We will be free to make our own mistakes’. But, what if that mistake means years of right-wing governments they abhor? The Wings’ poll makes it clear: When confronted with the reality of losing power, support for independence dwindles. Nationalists would rather stay in power in the current system, than have the possibility of their opposition take power in an independent Scotland. The irony is that Nationalists ARE currently getting the government they voted for. Scotland has had 13 YEARS of SNP government, an inept bunch of charlatans who deflect from their consistent failures and retain power simply by holding out a golden carrot of independence that blinds gullible voters. As Wings says:\u0026nbsp; If that’s how prevalent that attitude is among the SNP’s voters, who have no direct vested interest in the party being in power, we invite readers to contemplate how common it’s likely to be among the party’s elected representatives and payroll, whose very livelihoods depend on it. One thing that is true of all politicians: they seek to retain their power. So, why would any politician want to risk their comfortable salaries and power now, for a referendum and independence that gives up both? Why would Nicola Sturgeon give up power now, for a dream?\u0026nbsp; The short answer is: she won’t. She’ll keep on dangling that shiny golden carrot.

There is nothing, and no one, they would not sacrifice, take advantage of, exploit or attack in this all-encompassing obsession. An obsession that has divided our country, communities and families for the last decade.\u0026nbsp; I also commented that their schemes — always accompanied by massive amounts of publicity — always collapse when their poorly planned, and even more poorly executed ideas, face the harsh light of the real world. \u0026nbsp;I was thinking about these projects and the untold burdens that they placed on our lives, our futures and our communities, when I finally realised that the SNP\u0027s modus operandi is to hold us hostage and to ransom us to a future that is as poorly planned as all their other ventures.\u0026nbsp; A prime example is the now-deleted Tweet sent by Angus MacNeil, the MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (formerly known as the Western Isles), on September 3rd, 2019. MacNeil threatens to make Scottish Government support for a charity that strives to combat Scotland\u0027s tragically high drug death rate, which at the time of the tweet\u0027s writing, was the highest in Europe, contingent on its support for breaking up the United Kingdom. He is holding hostage those who care for some of the most vulnerable people in our community by threatening to allow the drug epidemic to go unaided unless we bend the knee and fall in line with him and his party\u0027s objectives.\u0026nbsp; This is not the first time we have seen such actions by the SNP; in fact, it has become common in their manner of government to use intimidation, neglect and favouritism.\u0026nbsp; In January of this year, John Mason MSP for Glasgow Shettleston, had this to say on Twitter, \"I will not be speaking up for constituents who want lower taxes, orange marches, keeping Scotland in the UK, etc.\" Again, we see how the SNP disregards the very people they are sworn to represent because we do not share their opinions.\u0026nbsp; With all the promises of a golden future that “independence” would supposedly bring us, the SNP are holding us, the Scottish electorate, hostage until we simply roll over and give in to their demands.\u0026nbsp; They are hoarding billions of pounds of UK taxpayer money intended for businesses so that they can use it for cheap political stunts, like the £500 NHS workers bonus, in the run-up to the 2021 election. Meanwhile, a comedy club business run by Tommy Sheppard, an SNP MP, has received more than £300,000 of taxpayer-funded support, while hundreds of more deserving businesses are denied. This shameful abuse of power cannot be allowed to continue; we cannot remain the hostages of a government hell bent on its divisive and poorly planned fever dreams. We must resist these captors and call out their underhanded and bullying, brutish behaviour; we must demand representation by people who will actually represent us and our needs, and we must be steadfast in our commitment to solidarity rather than separation.\u0026nbsp; The SNP claim they act in the interests of Scotland; they daily proclaim to speak in our name, but they don\u0027t represent us, the majority of the electorate, who see them for what they are and who are disgusted by their corruption. I will never be their hostage. We must all act to rid our country of these charlatans who would feed us poison only to profit from the antidote.","date":"2020-12-07","summary":"In my last commentary for The Majority, I spoke about how the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon, in particular, treat us — the Scottish electorate — as nothing..."},{"title":"Wanted: a worthy opponent to Nicola Sturgeon","url":"/articles/wanted-a-worthy-opponent-to-nicola-sturgeon/","content":"https://stephendaisley.com/2020/06/15/wanted-a-worthy-opponent-to-nicola-sturgeon/ Stephen Daisley, writing on his blog, says that frustration is rising as Scottish Nationalists fail to deliver results after 13 years in power. Three terms of Nationalist rule have produced little of substance and on education and health we have seen progress stall and even go into reverse. Meanwhile, sizeable reserves of political capital, parliamentary time and government resources have gone into a constitutional war of attrition. What exactly about the past 13 years would make anyone want another five? Of course, Nationalist voters will forgive any sin, including the destruction of our health, education, and civic services and as long as it means they have a chance to fulfil their immature dreams. But poor performance means nothing if it isn\u0027t called out. In part, this is because Scottish media is weak and compliant: -- please don\u0027t use that word Stephen, when we\u0027re much more than that -- blame the media for giving Nicola Sturgeon an easier ride than Boris Johnson gets from network news. There is some truth to this: Scottish broadcasters are generally less adversarial and one outlet in particular is positively chummy with the ruling party. Could, perhaps, Stephen be talking about STV? The channel that he left after alleged editorial interference form Pete Wishart and John Nicolson? Not to mention an utterly atrocious opposition: Never has such a mediocre government been blessed with an opposition that daren’t aspire to the dizzying heights of mediocrity. While he says Jackson Carlaw should be given time to make an impression (something that is highly unlikely in our opinion), Daisley unloads both barrels into Scottish Labour Leader, Richard Leonard. His time in charge of Scottish Labour has been a ghost leadership. There is no speech that sticks in the mind, no policy or campaign that bears his name, no political victory of any significance. A Labour leader must be an\u0026nbsp;activist yet Leonard’s captaincy has been marked by torpor and drift.

As expected, a host of insiders, including Scottish Labour politicians, are saying they are proud of what has been achieved, while Scots wonder if those politicians – who are almost all receiving a salary from the Scottish Parliament – have somehow missed the past 25 years. https://twitter.com/AnasSarwar/status/1789621341777178825 So let’s cast our minds back to 1997 and ask the question that is not being asked: What if legislative devolution was not part of New Labour’s manifesto, and it never happened? No Holyrood in Scotland. No £440 million spent on the ugliest building in Scotland. (That alone should have been enough to tell Scots where all this was going). No £100 million a year just running the assembly. No £770 million spent running the Scottish Parliament last year. No billions of pounds spent over the past 25 years, just to hear a bunch of non-entities, from all parties, flap their gums and make bad laws.\u0026nbsp; No renaming an assembly to a ‘Government’. No jumped up job descriptions and huge salaries for people who could not find employment elsewhere. No slow pans of ‘ministers’ walking into Bute House to take up do-nothing positions.\u0026nbsp; No SNP rising to power at Holyrood in Scotland and abusing their devolved remit to falsely claim a mandate and push for separation from the rest of the UK. No constitutional power grabs. No danger to the UK’s constitutional, economic, social and military integrity. No lie that breaking up the UK is a noble endeavour. No blaming EVERY. SINGLE. THING. on ‘Westminster’. No divisive referendum: Salmond unable to get a referendum on just 25% of the vote. None of the endless de facto referendum schemes and shenanigans that nationalists have tried to use to game the system in their favour. And still lose.\u0026nbsp; No seventeen years of SNP misrule in which almost all areas of domestic policy have been ravaged by incompetence. Our children better educated; our businesses thriving because of no constitutional uncertainty; a police force that serves the population, rather than its political masters. No Nicola Sturgeon and her husband. No criminal investigations nor embezzlement charges. No selfie tours.\u0026nbsp; No Humza Yousaf. No platform to promote the aims of Palestinian terrorists. No repressive Hate Crimes Bill.\u0026nbsp; No John Swinney.\u0026nbsp; Ferries delivered on time.\u0026nbsp; No misdirections about what is devolved and not. No grandstanding on international issues. The same taxes as people in other parts of the UK. No broken electoral system that put a tiny minority of extremist Greens in power. No Patrick Harvie or Maggie Chapman. No push to sexualise or mutilate school children. No Lorna Slater. No Bottle Deposit Return Scheme. Scots would be spared the disgusting sight of foreigners who come to the UK to take advantage of all its benefits and then try to break up our country. No pandering to the EU and endless cherry-picked comparisons to \u0026lt;insert small country here\u0026gt;. No centralisation of power in Edinburgh, away from local authorities. No constant whining about ‘democracy denial’ from people who lost the referendum fair and square. No venue for toxic nationalism to promote itself, using the power, funding and prestige of government.\u0026nbsp; No normalisation of toxic nationalism itself, an ideology based on greed and amplified grievance that attracts the worst lazy, incompetent, fact-challenged, economically-illiterate, divisive fanatics in Scottish society. No abuse from these same toxic nationalists claiming anyone against their failed plan is a ‘traitor’, ‘quisling’, ‘house jock’ or ‘should go back to England’. (Isn\u0027t that enough of a reason to say no in its own right?) Not to mention the appeasement of nationalism from the media and opposition politicians. All this has combined to create a Parliament that is, to many Scots, more remote than Westminster ever was. A bloated, expensive and remote talking shop that spends inordinate amounts of time and money debating and enacting bad laws, while imposing higher taxes and continuously grandstanding on foreign affairs, when all Scots want is for local services to be carried out more effectively. Scotland would be in a far, far better place if, back in 1997, The Labour Party had just said no and not indulged the soft nationalism of its Scottish MPs. They were warned. Are we \u0027stuck with it’? To mark today’s dreadful anniversary, some pro-UK commentators have written about devolution’s failures. And while it is welcome to see the media finally coming around, it\u0027s noticeable that while they all diagnose the symptoms, they are unwilling to treat the victim. Andrew Neil said in a tweet:\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/afneil/status/1789220009853485082 Tomorrow is the 25th anniversary of Scottish devolution. That silence you hear is the sound of nobody celebrating. Holyrood has been a dripping roast for the Scottish political elite and burgeoning nomenklatura, who’ve enjoyed salaries, expenses, perks, status and state funding beyond their wildest dreams. But for most Scots it’s been very thin gruel indeed. However, they only have themselves to blame: by their electoral choices over the past quarter century it is they who’ve turned it into the Numpty Nursery. And now there’s no way back. All fine, except for that last sentence: Why is there no way back? We’re not told. Is it because of the fear that nationalism would rise again? But we remember how Brexit, Boris, and Nicola Sturgeon’s daily Covid press conferences were supposed to get it over the top. And how none of it happened. Continuing the theme, yesterday in the Daily Mail, Stephen Daisley said, ‘Holyrood was a historic error and one we are now stuck with.’ https://twitter.com/AgentP22/status/1789187395461554209 Why are we stuck with it? We were stuck with the EU, until we weren’t. We were stuck with slavery until it was repealed. We were stuck with any number of bad laws and policies, until they were repealed. He elaborated in an article: There are some who would urge for its abolition. Westminster certainly has the authority to do so, but scrapping Holyrood without a referendum would be as democratically dubious as ignoring the EU referendum to prevent Brexit. Surely one of the best pro-UK commentators can come up with something better than this convoluted\u0026nbsp; straw man? As nationalists keep telling us, a referendum is achievable if there is the political will for it. But you will never even get a referendum on devolution if you think you can’t get one.\u0026nbsp; So how can we get one? What is devolution? First we need to make a distinction between legislative and administrative devolution. Administrative devolution existed before the Scottish Parliament, with power being devolved to local authorities working with The Scottish Office. Legislative devolution is when a devolved administration is allowed to set its own laws. In Scotland, we have seen how this has played out, with disastrous results, as the SNP and the SNP/Green alliance has proposed bad law after bad law, including the Named Person Scheme, Offensive Behaviour at Football Act, The Gender Recognition Reform Bill, Bottle Deposit Return Scheme and the Hate Speech Act. Both the GRR and BDRS were so poorly thought out that the UK Government had to step in, while all others have been abandoned, except for the recently enacted Hate Crime Act, which, due to overwhelming public outcry, may well be repealed in the near future. A reasonable person might ask: If the Scottish Parliament can only make bad laws, what’s the point of it at all? The basic idea of devolution is to bring power closer to the people, but this is often misinterpreted as bringing all power to local people. Power can be devolved to Scotland, or any region of the UK, without the need for a separate legislative parliament. Greater Manchester, for example, has a similar population to Scotland, yet is administered by its council and an independently-elected mayor.\u0026nbsp; The idea that a separate parliament should be set up for every five million UK residents is obviously nonsense. Should half of London have its own parliament with law-making powers? So what’s so special about Scotland that it needs an extra layer of government? That answer lies in history, when Labour thought that indulging soft nationalism would appease hard nationalism, while cementing their own power in Scotland. It did neither.\u0026nbsp; How can we abolish legislative devolution? There are two main ways to force the issue:\u0026nbsp; 1. Persuade a UK political party to include the abolition of Holyrood with an administrative devolution replacement in their manifesto for the next general election. If this party won an election on a manifesto pledge to abolish legislative devolution, then that would give them a cast-iron democratic mandate to do so.\u0026nbsp; 2. Ask the UK Government for a referendum to abolish or keep the Scottish Parliament. In either case, a referendum would have to take place. Despite the fact that the devolved legislatures’ ability to break up the UK should actually be seen as a UK-wide matter, to have political legitimacy, the decision to dissolve Holyrood must be one taken by Scots. This could be presented as a mirror to the 2014 ‘independence’ referendum (Actually a break-up-the-UK referendum). Some nationalists have countered that if there were to be a referendum on abolishing Holyrood, the question should be posed as a choice between abolishing Holyrood and Scotland leaving the UK. But they had their chance: now it’s our turn. If successful, a positive referendum result would lead to the UK Parliament enacting a Scottish Parliament Dissolution Bill. And Holyrood would be gone, by the consent of Scots. It is important to note that there is absolutely no requirement under the constitution to seek and receive the consent of the devolved legislatures beforehand. The democratic consent of the electorate of the devolved parts of the UK is all that’s required.\u0026nbsp; However, for either of these options to happen, public support has to be demonstrated, primarily through polling, but also through other activities, such as support from the media and from political figures.\u0026nbsp; Recent polling has put support for abolishing Holyrood at 20% with 20% against, leaving a huge middle ground that can be persuaded. And that’s before any campaign has started. Remember that Alex Salmond was able to convince the UK Government to offer him a referendum to break up the UK based on only 25% support in the polls.\u0026nbsp; What’s next? Opponents of abolishing Holyrood are quick to disparage any plan for change with: ‘What’s next? A return to Westminster rule?’, which is a bit rich, coming from nationalists who have spent decades assuring us, without evidence, planning or details, that everything will be fine after the break up of the UK. Nonetheless, we can outline some possible scenarios that show that local power will remain in Scotland, and be enhanced. We propose that a constitutional convention is set up to discuss the various options, of which we will briefly outline three: A return to the pre-1997 system of the Scottish Office and direct funding of Local Authorities. A committee made up of some of the 52 Scottish MPs currently sent to Westminster, combined with direct funding of local authorities. The above options, but with fewer, larger regions, perhaps with regional mayors. In all cases, there should be no avenue to expand any local authority or region to become a legislative body. It is important to note that administrative devolution is still devolution: people will still be able to exercise power at local areas, by voting for their local councillors, or regional mayors, while anything that affects the entire UK would remain within the remit of the House of Commons. Administrative devolution eliminates the fatal intrinsic flaw in legislative devolution that creates a\u0026nbsp; devolved legislature (Holyrood) that can be used as a platform to allow and encourage anti-UK separatism to rise to power and push for separation referendums, using the power of the legislative body itself. What are truly Scottish issues? The question that remains is: what issues belong to Scotland only? The Scottish Parliament, as a nationalist endeavour, has sought to centralise all Scottish services to Edinburgh. For example, Scottish regional police forces have been centralised into a single force, Police Scotland. There has also been the creation of a huge amount of government-funded third-party organisations, primarily in Edinburgh. We have seen how the Scottish Parliament has taken funds that were meant for local authorities and used them to fund their ‘national’ priorities. A prime example of this is spending hundreds of millions of pounds on bike lanes, while local authorities are having to cut facilities like libraries, swimming pools and teachers.\u0026nbsp; Abolishing Holyrood would cut out the middlemen and restore funding and power to local authorities. The creation of larger regions would stop excessive centralisation in Edinburgh, recognise that Scotland is not just The Central Belt, and it would stop the constant and unnecessary constitutional agitation that has stymied debate in Scotland for far too long by removing the primary platform for toxic nationalism to grow.\u0026nbsp; — If only more Scots had realised 25 years ago that this is where we would end up, then all this pain would have been avoided. But we can make change. We are most certainly not ‘stuck with’ devolution. Talk to your friends, build support and we can work together to move on from Scotland’s disastrous legislative devolution experiment, and make a better Scotland that works for ordinary Scots and not for a class of do-nothing politicians and their hangers-on. #AbolishHolyrood Written by Stephen Bailey and Mark Devlin.

After a hugely successful campaign that flew a #ResignSturgeon banner over Holyrood and saw #Resign Sturgeon billboards appear across Scotland, The Majority now takes the fight directly to Nicola Sturgeon’s constituency in Govanhill, Glasgow and to the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, using mobile digital ad vans carrying the message, ‘We don’t believe you Nicola’ and ‘#ResignSturgeon’. The schedule is: Tuesday 23rd March - Glasgow: Govanhill, West End and City Centre Photo stop at Govanhill Park (corner of Govanhill St and Langside Rd) at 11am. Wednesday 24th March - Edinburgh: Holyrood and City CentrePhoto stop at The Scottish Parliament Building at 12 noon. This campaign aims to tell Nicola Sturgeon that the majority of people in Scotland do not believe what she says and she must resign. After her testimony to the Scottish Parliament\u0027s inquiry into the Scottish government\u0027s handling of complaints against Alex Salmond (the Holyrood Inquiry Committee), only 35% of people believed she had given honest testimony (Panelbase 7 March). Yesterday, James Hamilton published his report on whether Sturgeon broke the Ministerial Code, noting that the matter of whether the First Minister misled Parliament is a matter for Parliament to decide. Today, the Holyrood Inquiry Committee published its report saying she did indeed mislead Parliament, therefore she must resign. Mark Devlin, founder of the Majority: The majority of Scots are not fooled by the First Minister’s changing stories, her forgetfulness, her evasions, her excuses, her secrets, her self-serving redactions or her lies. We have no confidence in the First Minister. Her reputation is in shreds and her credibility shot. She must resign immediately. The campaign theme — #ResignSturgeon — is part of an ongoing grassroots hashtag campaign on Twitter that has had hundreds of thousands of retweets and responses and has appeared over 80 times on Twitter’s ‘trending’ lists of the social network’s most popular hashtags. The Majority is Scotland’s leading anti-Nationalist media. Since its founding in June, 2020, it has grown to almost 50,000 social media followers. It aims to unite Scotland’s anti-Nationalist majority; say NO to IndyRef2; Expose Nationalism as a toxic ideology; Support effective anti-Nationalist politicians; and criticise media appeasement.

This act of remembrance to the fallen, has become a regular feature in my life for many years – missed only when I have been working overseas.\u0026nbsp; Under the grey skies, I paid my respects with other service veterans, while socially distancing. We refrained from shaking hands and hugging, but we Will Remember Them in the time-honoured fashion, regardless of the Scottish Government ban on gatherings. For veterans, ignoring rules and regulations goes against the grain. We are a well-disciplined group with the utmost respect for authority, regardless of political persuasion. The Scot Gov blanket ban on wreath laying ceremonies, carried out by old comrades, was a ban too far, especially as several controlled ceremonies have been permitted by the Government of the United Kingdom. An individual, who was previously unknown to me, appeared on my television screen last Thursday or Friday evening, telling us that we were not permitted to partake in wreath laying ceremonies under any circumstances. I had to google this person as I had never heard of him. It turns out that he is Graeme Dey, MSP (SNP) for Angus South. He also appears to be the Veterans Minister! Dey instructed us to carry out our homage to the fallen on our own doorsteps. Just like clapping for Nicola Sturgeon, I guess.\u0026nbsp;I quizzed several of my old comrades and not surprisingly, no one had ever heard of this fellow. During my Google search I came across a message from this sterling fellow, from two days ago: Big thank you to the SNP Activists who braved the cold and slippery conditions in Carnoustie this morning to distribute our survey forms and also to these who have been working under their own steam to the same end.\u0026nbsp; Now, call me a bluff old traditionalist, but I am thinking that the above-mentioned activity must have resulted in plenty of close contact between activists and the public. Why are such actions permitted for the anointed few, while the solemn act of remembrance is pushed back to our own doorsteps? This type of action is indicative of the SNP: a party that lacks empathy or sympathy with our proud Scottish Veterans.\u0026nbsp;This merry band of carpetbaggers love to flex their political muscle. It is the act of the playground bully. They play to a nationalist audience who see themselves in a David and Goliath situation, or perhaps playing out a Braveheart scenario. The Separatists however, in my opinion, have totally misjudged the mood of the people of Scotland. I admire the NHS and all they stand for. I clapped for them on my doorstep. I admire the care workers. I clapped for them on my doorstep. These individuals are indeed in the front line and are well deserving of the plaudits, however – there are varying degrees of “Front-Line Service”. I have experienced the shock wave of an explosive blast, the scream of an in-bound rocket, and the staccato drum of automatic fire, but I cannot imagine the horror, the mud, the blood and most of all the raw fear, of teenagers far from home with little expectation of survival. They are the epitome of Front-Line Service, and they are more than worthy of a small, safely managed act of remembrance in our proud country. The Scottish Government has no moral right to prevent these tributes to much braver men and women than them, or indeed, all of us.\u0026nbsp; This Sunday morning, 8th November at exactly 1100hrs, I saluted as I heard the bugle play The Last Post and The Flowers Of The Forest.

The Alba-SNP government has refused to comment on leaks that the post-Scexit Rebranding and De-Britification Commission has recommended a change to the country’s name, aiming to reposition it within the global marketplace. Rumours that Alba would be incorporated into the official nomenclature have been circulating for months since the SNP was relegated to junior partner in the ruling coalition. But officials are still wary. “How long before it becomes Albatross? You’ve got to be so careful with these things. It’s even the name of a waste disposal company in Singapore.” Scholars believe that Alba was derived from the Latin term ‘Albion,’ referring to the whole of the British Isles. “Through the mists of time, it gradually shrank to fit the borders of modern Scotland,” notes Professor Monboddo of Edinburgh University. “In a sense, you could say it really means Little Britain.” “And as for the Scotti, they were believed to be a tribe of Irish pirates, according to historians. But who the hell really knows? It’s probably just as accurate to call ourselves Albanians.” Negotiators in Brussels, however, point to concerns that the Republic of Albania may veto Scotland’s latest application to join the EU. “The game’s up if a Balkan backwater slams the door on us.” Meanwhile, among the business community, ‘Scotapore’ is strongly fancied, based on the workaholic, low-tax Asian city-state. “In fact, we’re trying to get sponsorship for the name change from Google or Disney,” explained Digby McAdam of Sachman-Golds. “We’ve even approached MacDonalds with the slogan ‘Ye canny whack it!’, but there are legal issues…plus associations with Sadism…etc.” Huawei, the Chinese mobile giant, is still said to be in talks, though critics suggest that the lack of tropical weather might be an obstacle. A spokesperson for the company denied any meteorological obstacles. “It’s the sweat of Scotaporean brows that will attract entrepreneurs.” “We believe everyone will skip to work while their managers belt out ‘I did it Huawei’.” Officials at Hollyrood were more rueful. “Given the state of our finances, it’ll probably be ‘My way or the Huawei\u0027.” So far, Bute House has been Mute House on the issue, but late last night, ministers were still insisting that the term ‘Scot’ will remain in the country’s name. “It’s absolutely non-negotiable.”\u0026nbsp; Insiders expect a compromise will eventually be found.

They point to other countries, demanding to be like them, “independent”, without the slightest realisation of the errors or ironies of the comparison. But, as we have repeatedly seen, Nationalists don’t acknowledge reality and fact, they only see that which suits them. Their own echo chamber isolates them from the world and its uncomfortable truths.\u0026nbsp; But, look across the map of the world and you will see the exact opposite: unions are normal. The forces of history have created a map marked by the unification of regions into the nation states we know today, consolidated by those who chose to fight together for common goals and to focus on what unites us rather than what divides us. Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, the United States, Australia, the UAE, Malaysia, India, Tanzania, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, and the list goes on and on.\u0026nbsp; These countries, formed by historical and interpersonal bonds and based on collaboration, are a testament to the enduring truth of unions, that together we are greater than the sum of our parts. These countries celebrate their diversity and cherish their individual identities, but they equally value the strength that comes from this collective endeavour and reject the narrow insular nationalism which seeks to break them apart all in the name of festering grievance.\u0026nbsp; In all the chaos of American politics in the past 48 hours, the razor-thin margins, the polling errors, the last-minute counts and even recounts, one thing has yet again been made very clear, that Puerto Rico values the union, regardless of who sits in the Oval office.\u0026nbsp; The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States of America and functions in much the same ways as the Crown Dependencies \u0026amp; Overseas Territories do for the UK, having its devolved legislature while also being US citizens, protected by the US military and using the US dollar.\u0026nbsp; It has a strong individual identity, manifested in its language, unique culture and even its own Olympic team, but also deep connections with the US formed through shared ideals, as neighbours, friends, family and through sacrifice and hardship in war. These connections have fostered the identity of being Puerto Rican and being American as mutually constructive rather than mutually exclusive.\u0026nbsp; On November 3rd, when Americans across the fifty states headed to the polls to elect their next president, so too did Puerto Rico. Yet Puerto Ricans could not yet vote for the US president under their present constitutional condition. Rather, they voted in a referendum for the immediate acceptance of Puerto Rico to full statehood as the 51st state of the United States of America, in so doing, yet again rejecting independence.\u0026nbsp; This is the third time in a decade that Puerto Rico has made this choice. It was one made in all the uncertainty of the election and COVID, of economic issues and global uncertainties and their decision recognised the inescapable truth that together we are bigger, stronger and richer.\u0026nbsp; Puerto Rico is not the first place to recognise and value this. Exactly one month ago, New Caledonia rejected independence for the second time in two years and famously so too did Quebec, twice.\u0026nbsp; Puerto Ricans are no less Puerto Rican because of their shared citizenship with the US. Neither are we Scots any less Scottish because of our citizenship of the UK. Unions unite, Nationalists divide. They seek to make us smaller, poorer and insular.\u0026nbsp; At the time of writing, the winner of the US election is not yet clear, but what is clear is that Puerto Rico has once again shown its commitment to a union, in its darkest hour.

This is the basis of my political beliefs and my commitment to Unionism and the British family of nations and people.\u0026nbsp; They are powerful arguments that we, a country welded together through shared pain and happiness, are \"better together\". That we are even bigger, even stronger and even smarter than we could ever be apart. These arguments for the UK, are made real in furlough payments, the vaccine rollout, the British Armed Forces, the NHS, and people coming together during the pandemic. They are also arguments that Labour has used since its birth.\u0026nbsp; In most things, I am a moderate and a centrist. After a life spent studying the outcome of differences that have turned toxic, I strive for commonality. I voted for the Lib-Dems in the 2019 election, because Jeremy Corbyn did not present the unifying vision I was looking for. With Corbyn gone, Starmer and Sarwar have the potential to gain my vote, because Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will not be in power forever. I will not throw the baby out with the bathwater simply because of who occupies Number 10 at the moment. While the politics of the whole of the UK do not reflect those in Scotland, it is often important to get to the big picture, especially as that shapes the way many people view the situation. The collective trauma of the last year has fundamentally reshaped Scotland, the UK and the world. The arguments that dominated our lives a year ago now seem stale and out of place, as we count our losses while looking to rebuild and reform. At a time like this, the candidate that can garner the widest support, is the one to get behind. I believe this is the strategy Anas Sarwar is banking on.\u0026nbsp; Sarwar has made his constitutional position very clear. He does not support independence and has said he will vote against any bill on it for the next five years. This is as good as never; the deeply wounded SNP government that may limp into office in May will never last five years. Therefore, attacking Labour on the constitution is pointless. Instead, I believe Sarwar’s approach is most likely to win the greatest number of potential voters, both soft Yes and soft No.\u0026nbsp; In yesterday’s leader\u0027s debate, the Conservatives attacked Labour on their commitment to the Union and for not committing to a pro-UK coalition platform. I can see how that may reflect badly on Labour, but digging deeper, I see it as primarily a means for the Tories to attract pro-UK voters who are the Conservatives\u0027 main voting block.\u0026nbsp; Those attacks are more about bolstering the Tory vote, rather than increasing the overall share of voters supporting pro-UK parties. The Conservatives want to keep their position as the primary opposition, even if that means poaching voters from Labour; they’re not interested in attempting to convert SNP voters.\u0026nbsp; The Conservatives are appealing to the Unionist vote; the SNP is appealing to the secessionist vote; it is only Labour that is trying to appeal to both camps, knowing that within the secessionist camp, a very significant amount of people do not want a referendum within the next five years and certainly not within the next two years. They are not surrendering their Unionist principles; they are simply being pragmatic and reflecting the position of the majority of voters who are overwhelmingly saying, \"let us get our country back together before talking about tearing it apart\". My overarching political and personal desire is for the peace, prosperity and stability of all people who call these islands home. On that basis, the Union is fundamentally important to me because we have seen its benefits in action more than ever over the last 14 months of the pandemic. I would not vote for a party that I thought would endanger either the UK or the recovery from the pandemic. The SNP’s second referendum plan risks both, so I would never vote for them. The Labour Party’s track record on the Union is complicated and often vague. Its past leaders were unsuitable. But, now under this new leadership, I believe it can be trusted, and look forward to voting for them in May. Angus Robinson is a lecturer at a UK university.

It is time, therefore, to dissect and discredit their preferred technique, \"whataboutery\", or the Scottish version, \"whitabootery\". Simply put, whataboutery serves two functions, firstly to try to put the person who asks the question on the defensive, and secondly to allow the person using whataboutery to deflect away and avoid answering the question asked. Whataboutery is a form of the logical fallacy of false equivalence. The technique, first used widely by the USSR, is straightforward: simply respond to any criticism with a question attacking your opponent. All questions about the ills and injustices of the regime; political oppression, genocide, nuclear catastrophes, corruption and\u0026nbsp; mismanagement, to name but a few, were met with questions on racial injustice in America and South Africa, heavy-handed police tactics in the UK against miners and strikers, dictatorship in Spain and so on. All meant to put the West on the defensive.\u0026nbsp; But two wrongs don’t make a right.\u0026nbsp; These days, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Xi Jinping and Nicola Sturgeon (what a\u0026nbsp; wonderful list to be a part of) use this technique every day. It was even satirised in the 2014 film The Interview in the\u0026nbsp; scene where Dave Skylark (James Franco) confronts Kim Jung-Un (Randall Park) over his nuclear weapons program leading to mass famine in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Kim Jung-Un retorts by mentioning that the incarceration rate per capita in the United States is the highest in the world.\u0026nbsp; Both are true, but it is fundamentally a false equivalence aimed, not at elevating and supporting change but, at dismissing the need for change on the basis that all are equally bad, though obviously, this is not true. Whataboutery portrays the fundamental insecurity of those who use this method of arguing, knowing that\u0026nbsp; they cannot defend their position through rational argument, so they must deflect.\u0026nbsp; Nationalists love whataboutery because their ideology is based on deflection: their ills are always someone else’s fault and no matter what they do, someone else has done something supposedly worse. One need only think of how the disgraced MP Margaret Ferrier has been defended by references to Dominic Cummings’s infamous drive, claiming she has suffered “trial by media” despite the earlier nationalist feeding frenzy over Dominic Cummings. Two wrongs don’t make a right. A typical day-to-day example of whataboutery is this exchange between Mr Cole-Hamilton MSP and a twitter user, who responds to Cole-Hamilton’s point about Scottish Nationalism’s attempts to disguise itself as not being populist Nationalism, with a question: “And Brexit isn’t about populaist separatism?” The respondent is not asking for a debate on how populism functions in British politics, they are not asking for Mr Cole-Hamilton’s position, one which he has already made very clear, nor are they trying to make a considered point on supposed similarities between Nicola Sturgeon and Jacinda Ardern. Instead they trying to discredit Cole-Hamilton by bringing up something unrelated, in an attempt to deny the veracity of his statement and shift blame from their side (the SNP’s use of nationalist and populist rhetoric) to Brexit, and attempts to link a pro-EU politician to Brexit simply because his party is connected to another party which sits in the same building as the current UK government which supports Brexit.\u0026nbsp; Whataboutery is conducted daily by the SNP at all levels of the rotten vine. On the 13th of May, when questioned about the level of care home deaths in Scotland being proportionally double to those in the rest of the UK, Nicola Sturgeon retorted by questioning the validity of the UK’s statistics and suggesting that the rest of the UK was underreporting deaths when we know for a fact that the UK government was overreporting.\u0026nbsp; When the Office for National Statistics released its findings, which showed Scotland had the third highest rise in death rates in Europe from the start of the pandemic until the middle of June, she repeatedly claimed that England had five times the case numbers of Scotland at the time despite the fact that the statistics she used \"do not allow for a meaningful comparison to be made\".\u0026nbsp; In these cases we see how whataboutery functions to attack a reasonable position by demanding the person answer for things that are totally unrelated to the original question or challenge. Its function is to deflect and to hold the debate ransom by implying the challenger is responsible for other evils in society.\u0026nbsp; It’s an attempt to capture the moral high ground by digging a tunnel under the hill. Whataboutery is the last redoubt of those who cannot offer a valid argument, it is defensive, and it is puerile. In the fight to end divisive nationalism we must be alert to these kind of responses and neutralise them by not responding to the whataboutery question, calling it out for what it is, and then insisting that the original question be answered.

The Abolish Holyrood campaign has taken off because of your support. We’ve gained over 3,000 Twitter followers, been featured in the press, and turned #AbolishHolyrood into one of the most talked-about hashtags in Scotland. Together, we’ve shown that the demand to end this failed parliament is real—and it’s growing. However, die to two important issues, it is not possible to continue to register a political party for 2026 at this time. The Campaign Name We had hoped to create a party with the name Abolish Holyrood, but the Electoral Commission (EC) will not allow “Holyrood” in an official party name. This also rules out any party name like, Close Holyrood/End Holyrood/Scrap Holyrood. However, we can use these statements on billboards, hashtags and other marketing. The EC suggested the best way forward would be for us to contacted the Abolish The Scottish Parliament Party (ATSPP) and ask them to work with us, noting that this party, despite being dormant for five years, could block any application we would make for a similar name. To cut a long story short: We met with \u0027Gus\u0027 Ferguson, leader of the ATSPP and proposed combining the dormant party\u0027s name with The Majority’s credibility and social media influence—60,000 of our followers, plus access to a wider anti-nationalist network of 250,000—as well as billboards and other marketing power to promote the campaign. As we would be leading the campaign and raising the funds, we asked Gus to make us as the primary officers. He said he would consider our proposal but did not respond to our calls. Eventually we were told that he did not want to cooperate with us in the party. Weeks later, after he ran in the Barrhead, Liboside, and Uplawmoor by-election as Abolish Holyrood with no support from us, and received only 27 votes, we contacted him again, offering to put our resources behind the campaign, and offered him a lead candidate position or, if he wanted, a crowdfunded financial arrangement. Again, he refused. Despite initially saying he was going to run under his other party, The British Unionist Party, and that ‘he wouldn’t stand in our way’, Gus now says he will run as ATSPP in 2026, feeding off our popularisation of #AbolishHolyrood. The result: a man with no social media presence, no organisational support and no marketing skill has blocked the campaign he claims to champion—and now plans to leech off the work we, and others, have done to build the #AbolishHolyrood movement in order to grab unearned votes by default. Given his behaviour, I advise people not to vote for Gus Ferguson\u0027s ATSPP. With this in mind, we would have had to move forward under a new party name, one that puts us at the top of the ballot paper: The best candidate for that name would have been A BETTER SCOTLAND, with the tagline Scrap Holyrood. This would have given us billboards and leaflets that say: SCRAP HOLYROOD – Vote for A BETTER SCOTLAND. With time, we could have made this work. However, we would still need to be funded.... Funding the Campaign At the end of September, we ran a short campign to guage interest for funding the party, hoping to raise pledges for a minimum of £3,000 a month to cover: Full-time campaigning by the team Party registration and compliance Meetings and events across Scotland Travel to reach communities everywhere Candidate selection and support Press releases and media outreach Campaign materials, leaflets, and billboards Website and back-office support However, we did not meet the pledge amount—in fact we were nowhere near it—so we cannot continue with the party registration and will not be able to run in 2026. We will continue, for now, as an activist group. It\u0027s very disappointing: I feel we really did have a once-in-a-decade chance to make history and finally put an end to the Holyrood disaster. But, for now, we\u0027ll have to wait. Mark Devlin: Founder of The Majority and leader of the Scrap Holyrood campaign.","date":"2025-09-23","summary":"First, a huge thank you.

Most of us sat complacently on our hands after devolution in 1999, and even after the SNP started forming governments, allowing our deep connections with the UK to be whittled away.\u0026nbsp; Everything that had been called ‘British’ had to become ‘Scottish’, to the extent that rabid nationalists will not buy anything ‘British’ or anything bearing a Union Flag. The apogee of this was Nicola Sturgeon’s downright rudeness in receiving PM Theresa May in 2016 against a background of two saltires rather than a saltire and a Union Flag. ‘We’ have supported political parties and politicians who claim to be for the union but show little sign of working for it. ‘We’, and they, have played by the rules and been far too polite while the SNP runs rings round us with lies and tricks.\u0026nbsp; Above all, the pro-union parties fight among themselves, without, apparently, the slightest notion that we are engaged in an existential struggle. From time to time, one of them will aim a broadside at the SNP, or at Ms Sturgeon herself, but in return they will receive insults and snide comments about their affiliations with the UK and its political leaders.\u0026nbsp; And that is that for the time being. This really is no use at all. What is the point of going into another election next year with the pro-union cause divided three ways? It is time for the pro-union parties to understand they have common cause as anti-Nationalists, put aside their petty rivalries and antagonisms and to start to work together, NOW. The most obvious constructive thing they could do would be to agree to field a SINGLE candidate between them in each constituency next May. Of course it would be difficult for them, but if they are in politics for an easy life, they should retire.\u0026nbsp; The only cause that matters next May is defending the Union, and the constitution is the ground on which the SNP and its allies – or rivals - will be fighting. Politicians have to realise that most people don’t fret about politics all the time and many have no allegiance to any particular party. Facing voters with a Nationalist or anti-Nationalist candidate would concentrate minds and give them a real choice. I don’t think that Scots deserve the mess our politics has become. I don’t think that we deserve to be dragged out of the UK and away from the material benefits it affords us, into a bankrupt Nationalist morass.\u0026nbsp; But what are we to do if there is no workable, sensible lead from the politicians who are supposed to be on our side?

Why do lies, fake news and misinformation gain so much more political traction than evidence-based facts? The answer to that question can be found in the world of tribal epistemology. In 2017, David Roberts of Vox news coined the term ‘tribal epistemology’ to describe a state of mind ’where you believe not what facts or reason or top experts say is true, but what your group or tribe say is true, especially its leaders’. Why bother going to all the effort of seeking the truth out for yourself, when you can hand that time-consuming, tedious task to someone in power, who you believe in and trust and then agree unquestioningly with whatever their version of the truth is instead? But, what if those leaders don’t go to the trouble of seeking out the truth. What if they abuse your trust and lie, would you still believe them because you are one of their tribe? In Scotland, where the Scottish Government’s own economists have just produced the most brutal set of GERS (Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland) figures ever published, one would have thought that any self-respecting Scottish Nationalist would realise that, given the evidence, the game was up. Surely, the record-breaking £36.3 billion fiscal deficit (22.4% of Scotland’s Gross Domestic Product) would cause some pause. Surely, the price of inflicting turbo-charged sado-austerity on the Scottish people in order to reduce the deficit in an ‘independent’ Scotland, would be too much even for the most diehard Braveheart to contemplate? Surely, they would agree with Scottish Labour Deputy Leader, Jackie Baillie, when she said ‘no credible politician can look at these figures and believe Scotland would be anything but weaker outside the Union’. Of course not. The official Nationalist response to the publication of the recent GERS figures is straight out of the tribal-epistemology playbook.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Starting with the maxim that, ’if you’re going to tell a lie make sure it’s a big one’, Kate Forbes, the Scottish Government’s Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Economy, said that Scotland’s largest ever deficit actually ’strengthens the case for independence’. The question is not why this outright lie isn’t laughed at, but why so many Scottish Nationalists believe her. Forbes, as the SNP’s spokesperson for Scotland’s finances, is the SNP’s tribal leader for fiscal matters. To her tribe, she is the credible source: she has all the status, the legitimacy, the trust and the power derived from her cabinet position for her tribe to believe. If she denies GERS, it is true to them. If she says a huge deficit is ‘no barrier’ to independence, then it’s true to them. This isn’t just a matter of opinion. In April 2021, Survation surveyed 1047 people aged over 16 living in Scotland to find out their attitude to the authenticity of GERS.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The following jaw-dropping findings show that the majority of Independence supporters surveyed believe the myths and mendacious falsehoods. Consider your answers to the following statements... The figures used to calculate Scotland’s deficit (the GERS figures) are made up by Westminster to hide Scotland\u0027s true wealth. 57% of independence supporters agree, compared to 9% of non-independence supporters Truth: GERS is compiled by the Scottish Government\u0027s own economists. Before oil revenues disappeared, GERS was routinely used by The Scottish Government as evidence that an ‘independent’ Scotland could prosper. Now it shows a huge deficit, the SNP routinely trash it. Scottish tax revenues are understated because of Scottish exports leaving via English ports. 54%\u0026nbsp;of independence supporters agree, compared to 16% of non-independence supporters Truth: There is no such thing as an export tax. Scottish tax revenues are understated because taxes generated by the whisky industry are not properly allocated to Scotland. 66%\u0026nbsp;of independence supporters agree compared to 21% of non-independence supporters.\u0026nbsp; Truth: See above. There is no such thing as an export tax. Scotland is only seen to be running a deficit because some costs outside of Scotland, like HS2 and infrastructure spending in the South East, are charged to Scotland. 55% of independence supporters agree compared to 11% of non-independence supporters\u0026nbsp; Truth: Scotland is not charged anything for HS2 or Crossrail. In fact, Scotland receives funds as a result of these projects due to ‘Barnett consequentials’. Scotland spends more than it raises in taxes.\u0026nbsp; Only 20% of independence supporters believe this, compared to 46% of non-independence supporters Truth: In 2020, Scotland spent £36.3 billion more than it raised in taxes. The problem isn’t actually in the amount raised; the issue is that Scotland spends £2210 more per person on services. These figures stand as an indictment of the post-truth tribal politics of SNP and Green leaders who, rather than face reality, feed their followers misinformation and lies, while trashing credible and reliable evidence based information. Partick Harvie, joint-leader of The Scottish Greens response to Gers is a prime example of this : GERS is far from being the incisive analysis of the Scottish economy that some make it out to be. Each year the same people leap on it to make the same points about the constitution, when it tells us nothing about the real economic challenges and choices facing us. Rather than spelling out how Scotland would tackle the fiscal deficit, Nationalist leaders have denigrated the work of the Scottish Government’s own economists, replacing it with vacuous, absurd soundbites. They have radicalised their supporters into believing myths and falsehoods to reinforce their mutual dream of an independent Scotland. These leaders are either incompetent in finding the truth or they know the truth and deliberately mislead their own followers for their own political power.\u0026nbsp; Either way, the SNP / Green response to GERS tells us that the economic price that Scots would pay for independence would be austerity lasting for a generation. In order to keep the Scexit dream alive, the truth about the economics of independence has been sacrificed on the high altar of conspiracy theories and lies.\u0026nbsp; Follow Robert Hoskins on Twiter @hoski67","date":"2021-09-16","summary":"It is often said in these post-truth times, that a lie has gone half-way around the world before the truth has put its boots on.

A few minutes after 8am, my daughter appeared to relay the news. But, something didn’t seem right. Instead of As, two of her results, for Physics and Computing Science, were Bs. My mind went back to her last parent-teacher conference, just as the Coronavirus crisis was starting. Her Computing Science teacher was effusive in praise. ‘I’ll be recommending an A,’ he said. Later this morning, I received an email from the school, confirming that he had indeed recommended an A. So had her Physics teacher. Then the questions started: How did this happen? Did it happen to everyone? What methods were used? Judging by the angst on social media, this scene has been replayed in thousands of families across Scotland. According to Education Secretary John Swinney, teachers’ estimates were 10.4% too high, so 6.9% of those estimates were adjusted up and 93.1% were adjusted down, with 96% of all adjusted grades changed by one grade. In a statement today, Swinney seemed happy that results only dropped by one grade. Sure, that’ll make the kids that lost University places or saw their hopes dashed feel much better. Even worse, according to education experts, the downgrading has not been applied equally. If a school had historically low levels of educational attainment, then its results were downgraded more. The poorest pupils Higher pass rates were reduced by 15.2 per cent between teacher estimate and the final result. For the richest, it was just 6.9 per cent. That means bright kids at low-quality schools are doubly punished. Not only is the quality of their education poorer, but when they do well depite that, they’re knocked back by an unfair qualification system. The situation is so bad that Mhairi Black has even asked for a review. Yet Swinney seems happy that the overall pass rate is up. One can’t help thinking that a thumb was put on the scale to give a good headline: ‘Scottish Education Rates Improve’. A long line of Nationalist education failures\u0026nbsp; In August 2015, Nicola Sturgeon declared that education was the policy area that mattered most to her.\u0026nbsp; Let me be clear—I want to be judged on this. If you are not, as First Minister, prepared to put your neck on the line on the education of our young people, then what are you prepared to? Since, in over 13 years of Nationalist ineptitude, we have seen no actual evidence of a beheading yet,\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ll list the SNP\u0027s education failures in the hope that parents may finally lead her to the guillotine. Scottish education, once something Scots boasted about, has declined since 1999 to the point where reading and maths are just about world average, and science is below average.Scottish education standards are now worse than in England.To hide declining standards, the Scottish government cancelled annual surveys of literacy and numeracy that had, on the whole, replaced them with new tests that were not fit for purpose.Class sizes are nowhere near what was promised.Teacher numbers have declinedAnd a personal note, disruption is rife and resources are inadequate. My son was not able to study Physics for months, due to a teacher shortage. Like thousands of parents, I will be appealing my daughter’s results. If only we could appeal the Scottish Government\u0027s results. In fact you can, and it’s easy: the easiest way to stop inept Nationalist control over Education is to vote for the strongest anti-Nationalist candidate in your constituency.\u0026nbsp; It’s a bit like a multiple choice exam with a single, easy, answer. Put your cross next to anyone but the SNP or Greens and give Nicola and her cronies a lesson they won’t forget. Mark Devlin is the publisher of The Majority PS: A final word to Nationalists reading this: You have caused this. We cannot get back to normal politics where health, education, and jobs can be given proper attention until you stop ruining our politics with your immature dreams of Separation. Stop being so selfish and let the rest of us move on. Help us fight back In just a few weeks, The Majority has grown to over 6000 social media followers and hundreds of thousands of article views. But, we still have a long way to go to beat Nationalist media, like The National newspaper, which pumps out ugly propaganda to over 100,000 followers.

But, som..."},{"title":"When?","url":"/articles/when/","content":"When? It’s the perpetual separatist question. A question that seeps from every utterance. When will our ‘independence’ come? When will we be ‘free’? When will we get a second referendum? I was asked recently, when I believe it is the right time to hold a second referendum and I gave it some thought. I said that I didn’t believe it should be this year or, for that matter, this decade. Perhaps after then? I was then asked, “Well, hasn’t Brexit changed everything?”, to which I replied, \"Brexit changed a country, a pandemic changed the world, and neither solved what was already festering. It only made it worse.\" Look at what people are worried about today: it’s not constitutional grandstanding and divisive campaigns. People worry about whether their kids can go to school tomorrow, whether they will have a job next week, whether all their loved ones will be alive next month, and whether this strange reality we have had forced upon us for a year already will be here through 2021. It’s survival, not separation that people care about, now more than ever. The pandemic changed the argument for a decade or more, as we, as a planet, rebuild from an event that occurs once in a century, and a real century at that. However, even in the midst of the COVID crisis, essential day-to-day governance must still go on. And these, in Scotland, are a record of dismal failure. Our First Minister wants us to be a leader in the European Union. We already lead it in numbers of deaths from drugs per capita.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Our educational system, once the pride of our nation, has dropped ever further behind other parts of the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. Our manufacturing is in ruins. Our bridges cannot stand our weather, and neither can our roads. Our healthcare system, even before the pandemic, is a shambles as flagship hospitals stand idle. Their services are cut. The Scottish ‘Government’ cannot even guarantee the delivery timeline of a vaccine already in our possession.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Our police forces have been bankrupted by a disastrous politically-motivated unification. Our councils have been stripped of power and funding to satisfy the usual nationalist demands for centralisation and control. Our island communities are deprived of ferries that are too big for their ports and whose costs mount by the day. Soon it will be more cost-effective to raise the wrecks from Scapa Flow, and use them instead. Her administration seems to make its objective to dabble in totalitarian legislation, and our largest city, proudly represented by the First Minister herself, is becoming more like a slum each day. Except for herself, her whole party is void of any notable political personalities and are only known by the scandals they are embroiled in. Despite the decades the SNP have had to formulate a viable plan for secession, we still don’t know what currency we would use, what kind of documents we would need to visit our friends and loved ones a few miles down the road, or what kind of national and international relationships we would have, let alone how we would be provided for, represented or even defended. There is no plan for how we would join her much-beloved European Union. If the SNP could not convince us of their fever dreams when the oil flowed like water and the economy was stable and improving, how on earth can they convince us when we are in the midst of the worst recession for 300 years and the worst pandemic for 100 years? But then the SNP don’t need to convince us, they simply need to trick us. Their aim is to distract us from our real problems by pretending they have something better to offer. So, First Minister, and this band of Nationalists, when is the right time for another referendum? That is simple. When you can accurately tell us where we will be in 10 years; economically, socially and politically. When you can demonstrate to us that you can reduce drug deaths. When our education, policing, manufacturing, health care and infrastructure are secured and well provisioned for a decade. When we can go outside and see our loved ones again. Then, and only then, do I believe that the time is right to hold another referendum. I am afraid it will be a rather long wait. In the meantime, I do wish you would focus on the job you have and not the job you want.","date":"2021-01-05","summary":"When? It’s the perpetual separatist question.

Hi I’m Mark Devlin, We’ve all seen the hideous scenes at the English border where a group of flag-waving Scottish Nationalists,\u0026nbsp; thought it would be fun to tell English people coming to Scotland to f-ck off.\u0026nbsp; But, really, why should we be surprised when Nicola Sturgeon openly talks about closing the border to the English? Why would we think her followers wouldn’t take action? I’m only surprised that Nicola wasn’t there herself, wearing her tartan facemask, pulling over lorries and checking drivers to see if\u0026nbsp; they had cockney accents. Look, we all know the truth. Scottish Nationalism is driven by anti-English racism. Nationalist politicians have spent their entire lives dedicated to amplifying grievances to gain political power, using every trick they can to turn a party of cranks and Nazi sympathisers into something more palatable. But you can’t hide the core.\u0026nbsp; So now when all their hard work breaks out the open they try to condemn it? Give me a break. They should own it. They made it.\u0026nbsp; Instead they try to distance themselves. \u0027It was only a few nutters\u0027. \u0027We’re not like that\u0027. \u0027We’re civic and joyous\u0027.\u0026nbsp; The truth is that Scottish Nationalism, like Nationalism anywhere in the world, is pushed by mediocre politicians who can’t offer anything more than pushing easy, petty grievances. In 21st century Scotland, why do we let these losers get away with this? Partly because we’ve all got so used to it. That’s why it’s no surprise. And where are our political opposition leaders? They’re invisible and weak. Today I saw opposition MPs and commentators, many of whom should know better,\u0026nbsp; praising Nationalist politicians for distancing themselves from the nutters they encouraged.\u0026nbsp; Your job isn’t to praise then, it’s to bury them.\u0026nbsp; You should be uniting the anti-Nationalist vote and hammering them: Tell them: Your party caused this. Nicola Sturgeon caused this. Every Nationalist who voted for this is part of this. All decent people reject your toxic Nationalism and we will defeat it at the ballot box.\u0026nbsp; Is that really so difficult? Step up or get out of the way and let people who want to fight do your job. The sooner this ugly Nationalism is put in the dustbin of history the better. Scotland will be better.

On August 24, Len Pennie, a 21-year-old woman who posts poetry and \u0027Scots Word of The Day’ videos on social media, under the name Miss PunniePennie (@lenniesaurus), made a false allegation that I harassed her, while claiming I am ‘creepy’ and ‘hateful’. Previously Pennie claimed I was a ‘bigot’ and a ‘bully’. Pennie did this, I believe, to gain sympathy from her followers at my expense. This claim was taken up, without investigation, by Janey Godley, the comedian, who posted about the false allegation four times in one day, to get her followers to harass me.\u0026nbsp; Online harassment is a serious issue. As the father of a 17-year-old girl, the idea of a middle-aged man harassing a young woman online horrifies me, as it should most decent people. However, that is simply not the case here. I did not harass Len Pennie in any way. I will show that these claims are false. I am a respectable, happily married, family man and neither Len Pennie nor Janey Godley has the right to make these disgusting accusations and bully me. They should both apologise.\u0026nbsp; For those who don\u0027t know who I am, I am the publisher of The Majority, which (I hope) gives a voice to the majority of Scots who are against Scottish Nationalism. Before I returned to Scotland in 2016, I had long experience in publishing in Japan, in the US and in Scotland. I founded and published 707 weekly issues of Metropolis, Japan’s No. 1 English magazine. I also founded japantoday.com, the largest news and discussion site in Japan. After 26 years overseas, I came home to Scotland, where I have been working, primarily as an Internet marketing consultant, as well as running The Majority.\u0026nbsp; I have long experience in online discussions. In fact, when I built Japan Today, I was the first person to put reader discussions under the news stories, an innovation that spread worldwide. As part of that project, and other online forums I have created since, I have written policies to regulate online behaviour and also worked for many years as an online moderator, policing users’ language and behaviour.\u0026nbsp; I have been posting online since before the internet even started, on online bulletin boards. I edited hundreds of issues of a weekly magazine. So I try to be careful with my words. I have never harassed anyone online or offline: I’ll challenge them and I’ll mock them, but I don’t overstep and harass them. DECEMBER 2020 Harassment implies multiple contacts, but I have had only one direct communication with Len Pennie, in late December 2020, when she invited Twitter users to comment on her work. At that time I hadn’t blocked her, so her posts would occasionally appear when someone else retweeted them on my timeline. This is our conversation in its entirety, which started with Pennie challenging her critics to drop their anonymity. If ye want tae gie me hate, why no drop the anonymity and face me lit the big brave men ye hink ye are? Come oan, show us the bawheid ahint the keyboard. Are ye feart ae a wee lassie? Or that abdy that kens ye in real life wid be mortified tae see their da/brother/son is a bully? Note how she presents herself as a ‘wee lassie’. As I don’t like people playing the victim and stereotyping their critics, I replied: MD: I\u0027m not anonymous. It\u0027s bad enough you make insufferably smug videos in ridiculous dialect trying to make a \u0027thing\u0027 out of Scots words that no-one uses. But then trying to claim you\u0027re a victim when people don\u0027t like them? Away an\u0027 bile yer heid.LP: \"I\u0027m not anonymous\" 1. What\u0027s your name? 2. What do you look like? 3. What exactly about my content makes your willy shrivel up? I didn’t comment on the shocking misandry of this last sentence at the time. MD: I\u0027ve said my piece. You really need to have a thicker skin if you\u0027re going to do this. Playing the victim while insulting and stereotyping those who don\u0027t like your work is not a good look.LP: So you ARE an anonymous account then. Thanks for playing. If I had thin skin, bullies like you would have run me off this website MONTHS AGO. Now please, don\u0027t let the door hit your bigoted arse on the way out. Bye bye baby. XMD: Jeez-o. So now I\u0027m a bully and a bigot for telling you that your videos are insufferably smug nonsense? Get a grip. From start to finish this exchange took less than 30 minutes. For the record, my account isn’t anonymous. At that time my bio linked to The Majority\u0027s About page and I had one of my video commentaries pinned to the top of The Majority’s public feed. Criticism of someone’s work, at their invitation no less, is not harassment. I stated my opinion, and for that I was branded a ‘bigot’ and a ‘bully’ and told I had a ‘shrivelled willy’. I quickly realised that Pennie was a ‘professional victim’, in that she was inviting criticism of her work as a way to gain sympathy from her followers. It worked. She gained support from Godley and others, who were willing to overlook her aggressive sense of victimhood. In reply to someone who said I was complaining about Pennie’s politics: I don\u0027t care what her politics are. I simply dislike her promotion of Scots words no-one uses, her smug delivery and gigantic sense of victimhood. Apparently, for that crime, she\u0027s labelled me as a bigot, a bully, she\u0027s insulted me and tried to pile on me with her followers. Shortly thereafter, I blocked Pennie from viewing my tweets. Replying to another poster, I said: If she can\u0027t take criticism without playing the victim and resorting to abuse and insults, she\u0027s not only on the wrong platform, she\u0027s in the wrong industry. In any case, I\u0027ve blocked her insufferable nonsense now. From December to the end of August I did not look at her tweets. I’m simply not interested. THE THINNEST-SKINNED WOMAN IN SCOTLAND The other person who indulges in the same kind of behaviour is Janey Godley (@JaneyGodley). Many on Scottish Twitter have suffered pile ons from her followers and will recognise the same gigantic sense of victimhood. As just one example, I posted an image of a mock autobiography as part of the #NicolasBookClub series. She immediately claimed I was mocking her mother’s murder (not sure how that’s a connection) and said she was going to sue me for copyright infringement (she didn’t). For good measure, and to make money, she promoted her real autobiography in a link in the comments.\u0026nbsp; Irrespective of the merits of her comedy, which is like the traffic cone on that statue\u0027s head: mildly amusing the first time you see it, but beyond that you’re left thinking, ‘Is this really the mediocrity our culture celebrates?’, Godley is a living parody of a comedian who can’t take a joke. She’s quite possibly the thinnest-skinned woman in Scotland. Who on earth thought a divisive figure, who paraded a sign calling the President of the United States a \u0027c*nt\u0027, would be perfect to head up ads for Scottish tourism and COVID? The answer is that Godley serves an important role for Nicola Sturgeon, as a reverse court jester —presenting a boring, bookish and overbearing lawyer as a folksy, jokey \u0027woman of the people\u0027. Godley\u0027s comedy isn\u0027t selling laughs, she\u0027s selling power. And for that, she\u0027s handsomely paid with your money. But with these victim types, engaging simply isn’t worth the bother. So I leave her alone. AUGUST 24 In the early hours of August 24, just under eight months after the inital converation with Pennie, I responded to a comment by @FacundoSavala (FS) and another user, DR:: FS: That @Lenniesaurus strikes me as a lassie who gets ragey when her parents misgender her fave Twitch heroes, or when they do the recycling wrongly.MD: Stay away. She\u0027s a professional victim.DR: I’m blockedMD: Good. Not only will you avoid her self-satisfied and pretentious \u0027poyums\u0027 and tweets based on Scots words that no-one has ever heard, you\u0027ll avoid her claiming to be victimised by men when they criticise her \u0027art\u0027. Best avoided.DR: Is this the same one who did that cringe poem during the football that the bbc thought was a great idea to promote?MD: No, that\u0027s someone else. Although I don\u0027t doubt that the BBC will soon be getting this one on there, for some \u0027genuine Scoats content and poyums\u0027. This is an example of the utter drivel she spouts: Scots word of the day: WABSTEID Meaning: Website Example: Hae a wee snatch at thon wabsteid. Website was coined in the 1990’s afore yous gie me snash. I have never, ever heard anyone in Scotland call a website a ‘wabsteid’. It’s utter nonsense. It is, to use a good Scottish word, shite. (Funnily enough, just a few days after my comment, BBC Scotland ran a segment on Pennie, talking to her about Sir Walter Scott’s Waverley, which she hadn’t even read.) Anyway, a Twitter search shows that my entire history of my comments to Len Pennie consists of three Tweets interacting with her, five discussing her, and a few more telling people to avoid her.\u0026nbsp; During the same day, I was surprised to receive a tweet from a user called @Friseal\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; This You Mark Devlin?\u0026nbsp;Harassing young females and abusing them online?\u0026nbsp;Bit of a tough guy behind your keyboard, yeah?\u0026nbsp;The lassie has asked you to stop!!!\u0026nbsp;Get a fucking grip of yourself!!\u0026nbsp; The post had a screenshot of a post by Pennie, written that day: Hello@themajorityscot, Mark Devlin. You’re old enough to be my dad. I gave you the benefit of the doubt at Christmas because I assumed you’d had a bad time of it?, but I’d like to ask you publicly to stop harassing me. It’s creepy, it’s hateful and it’s just sad. Note how this tweet is framed. I am a man, ‘old enough to be her dad’ harassing a young girl (she calls herself a\u0026nbsp; ‘wee lassie’ when she’s actually 21), and how she falsely paints herself as someone concerned about my wellbeing ‘giving me the benefit of the doubt because I was having a bad time of it’. Read the earlier exchange; there is no benefit of the doubt. What exactly about my content makes your willy shrivel up? Pennie included screenshots of the previous day’s conversation with Facundo and DR. As I had blocked her, she would not have been able to see these tweets without either evading the block or someone else sending her the posts. Either way, my posts were not imposed upon her. In fact, in a follow-up post when someone asks, ‘doesn\u0027t he know he can block you?’ Mark he HAS ME BLOCKED, he\u0027s directing hate my way and he\u0027s actively searching up my tweets to screenshot. Absolute incel behaviour. You can\u0027t be harased by someone if you have to evade a block to see their tweets Which proves that she evaded the block. BTW, an incel is an ‘involuntary celibate’ someone who is frustrated that they are not able to get a woman. It is being used as a slur on my manhood. My wife and partner of 38 years would differ with that assessment. As a woman, she thinks (and I quote) that: Pennie does a disservice to other women by hiding behind her man-blaming ‘wee lassie’ persona; instead she should act like the grown woman she is. Pennie’s post was sent to her 103,000 followers. Her post was retweeted 130 times. At the time of writing, the post has over 1600 likes and 113 comments.\u0026nbsp; Pennie’s claims were retweeted FOUR TIMES by Janey Godley, to her 240,000 followers.\u0026nbsp; Why can’t you just leave her alone? WHY do you KEEP hassling this young woman?The @themajorityscot and the right wing angry men hounded this poet for months - of course George Galloway joined in and they made a wee circle of older angry men - staring down a young lassie performing poems - creepy as fuckWhat a surprise (link to the article in The National)The old disgruntled Scottish Tories and right wing, red trouser wearing cabal of men who hound this young woman for creating poetry is appalling - we see EVERY ONE of you Here are just a few examples of the hundreds of comments from Godley’s supporters: Nothing says pathetic incel troll like harassing a young girl online and encouraging others to do so just because you don\u0027t like that she speaks and promotes Scots. Absolute roaster and complete fanny.What a dreadful man. I\u0027m sorry you have to put up with these distorted species of menfolk. Please don\u0027t let it discourage you from your fabulous creative workHas anyone else noticed how similar Mark and Mary look? Almost like they were related before they were married? Might explain a few things….Get him reported tae the polis for harassment,If it were a perfect warld; he would be arrested juist fur Tweetin that.blocked. Report this to the police, this comes under the new stalking laws from 2019 All of these comments are based on a false accusation. Each of these comments damages my reputation. Additionally, Pennie’s comments were then reported in The National, a Scottish newspaper, with the headline: Scots poet Len Pennie hits out at \u0027creepy, hateful\u0027 remarks by The Majority This article, based on a false accusation, also seriously damages my personal and business reputation. Based on the contents of this post, I expect an apology. A TORRENT OF ABUSE The Crown Prosecution Service defines harassment as:\u0026nbsp; repeated attempts to impose unwanted communications and contact upon a victim in a manner that could be expected to cause distress or fear in any reasonable person. I have only had one direct communication with Len Pennie. I highly doubt any ‘reasonable person’ would say that the criticisms of her work at that time or more recently were designed to cause distress or fear. None of my communications were imposed on her. She invited my comment in December 2020 and was blocked from viewing recent comments. Contrary to her claim, I did not harass her, either in a legal sense or a common sense sense. As I have not harassed her, her characterisation of me as being ‘creepy’ and ‘hateful’ are also false. I decided that the best way to avoid further accusations was to not respond. I had to sit here and watch the abuse pile up, and not respond to any of it. These people probably think they are good people... She doesn’t want to fuck you, mate.Impotent “man” threatened by young, intelligent and capable woman, takes to to Twitter in rageShe probably reminds him of the last woman who laughed at his shrivelled prick.It is sad and pathetic. Wee man with a wee willy syndrome most likely. If you don\u0027t like someone\u0027s art, then ignore it, why go to the effort of trolling for absolutely no reason then when asked to stop, then keep at it and troll more especially behind a hidden profile.He thinks if he does this keech his micro-penis will grow.Another little mommy\u0027s boy with a tiny willy... it\u0027s the only place he thinks he has power…Predator These were especially annoying... Twitter has this really great feature where you can no longer see the tweets of people you don\u0027t want to. I know its fancy but I\u0027m sure a guy like you will work it out, block her and she\u0027ll live happily ever after. #getagripMaybe just do what she asked and leave her alone instead of trying to start your own pile on? I imagine behind your anon account you\u0027re an actual adult? Maybe act like one? Just ignore her or block her if she\u0027s upsetting you.Look, she doesn’t want to engage with you, so what is the problem? Like in real life, you don’t need to talk to everyone and they don’t need to talk to you. So jog on and find someone who does want to chat. Because she was blocked and I was actually telling people to stay away from her. She evaded my block, came into my timeline, and used those posts, along with Godley, to lie about me and encourage over 340,000 followers to pile-on and abuse me. False claims demean the actual victims of online harassment. Online harassment is a serious issue that causes distress to many. However, criticising someone’s work, at their invitation or not, whether it is twice in a six month period or even more than that, is not harassment. Commenting on a timeline that a person is blocked from viewing is not harassment. Comments telling people to avoid someone are not harassment. Godley and Pennie are simply bullies, who say, ‘If you dare to criticise our behaviour, even behind our backs, we will find out and you will suffer.’ But, it is not acceptable for Godley and Pennie to make false claims at my expense to gain sympathy from their followers. It is not acceptable to bully someone so that you can appear more virtuous to your followers. They really think their shit doesn\u0027t stink. They endlessly proclaim about how they support the marginalised, and support those with mental health issues, while simultaneously indulging in online abuse that hurts their targets\u0027 mental health. I am well aware that it is impossible to ‘win’ with these professional victims. If I post anything defending myself, including this article, they’ll simply whine ‘Oh he’s STILL posting about her. He’s obsessed! Creepy! Stalker! Incel!’ and their fans will say ‘Why are you harassing that wee lassie.’ But Len Pennie isn’t a ‘wee lassie’, she’s a grown woman, nearly 22 years old, and one of her adult responsibilities is to not indulge in false accusations. And it’s the responsibility of all of us online to do our best not to try to damage people by repeating lies. GODLEY\u0027S \u0027APOLOGY\u0027 It’s difficult to write that I have been bullied. It feels shameful, and no doubt there will be many Godley fans who will instinctively want to victim-shame me. But the truth is that this incident upset me quite badly; it was the lowest point in the entire time I’ve been doing The Majority. Over the course of two days, I had to watch as hundreds of people, prompted by Godley and Pennie’s lie, repeated their false accusation, while insulting and demeaning me in the most derogatory terms, while not being able to fight back in case they did it even more. I knew I was being bullied, but couldn’t do anything about it. Worst of all: their bullying achieved its result; it kept me silent, even until this morning. I actually wrote this article in the days after I was harrassed, but decided not to publish it, to avoid further pile ons. However, today I was so sickened by Godley’s apology and her continuing claims to victimhood that I decided enough was enough. Godley\u0027s \u0027apology\u0027 makes it appear as though she only posted a few problematic tweets Reading this text, it\u0027s clear that Godley would like you to think that her abuse is confined to just a few tweets. But her tweets don\u0027t stand alone; they are part of a pattern of online abuse and bullying behaviour, backed with a gigantic sense of victimhood. Even today, Godley has claimed to be the victim twice: once to say she’s held to a higher standard because she’s a woman... It is what it is two wrongs don\u0027t make a right I have to be held to a higher standard because I\u0027m a woman ...and again to claim her mental health is suffering. It’s simply revolting when an abuser claims the privilege of the people she abuses.\u0026nbsp; https://twitter.com/STattisconie/status/1435618759490875392 Always the victim. I also noticed that Godley\u0027s apology wasn\u0027t directed to any particular person. It’s easy to apologise to nebulous victims without a name. It’s easy to get ’apology praise’ from your followers when there isn’t a face to put on the victims.

In its 20th year, we are now in the ridiculous situation where the SNP, a party that never supported Devolution and wants to destroy it as soon as it can, is saying they support Devolution (they don’t), while Scottish Tories, who also never wanted Devolution, and who are appalled at the SNP takeover of the institution, are also saying they support it (they don’t). So who actually wants it? According to the media, Boris has made the unpardonable error of telling the truth. Even Andrew Neil has said Boris has gone too far by calling Devolution a ‘disaster’. But, a look at how Devolution has performed against its intent, shows that it has failed on almost every level.\u0026nbsp; It’s not enough to say that these failings are ‘our failings’. Failings are failings irrespective of who is to blame. Contrast this list of failings with its purported successes: Free university education (where poor workers pay for middle-class kids’ education and places for Scottish kids are rationed)Free prescriptions and other freebies (all paid for by the UK taxpayer) Baby Boxes (a wasteful policy that should have been paid for by the private sector). Not much to show for 20 years. Perhaps Andrew, like most commentators, thinks that there is a lot of support for Devolution? In a Twitter exchange on this topic, a Nationalist referred me to the Scottish Social Attitudes survey, which showed that in 2020, 51% of respondents wanted ‘independence’, while 7% wanted no parliament at all. The National reporting on the survey said that ‘just 36% of Scots want Devolution’, a number that has been consistently dropping since 2012, when it was at around 60%. That 36% must surely be shrinking every day as people become more aware of Devolution’s failures. I suspect there are only a few groups of people who actively want Devolution: Holyrood politicians, the Scottish Government and their many hangers-on. Personal power and troughing drive that support. For the rest of us, it’s been a failure. A £100 million a year disaster that has not helped ordinary people. But is abolition the answer? The Abolish The Scottish Parliament Party thinks they can capitalise on growing dissatisfaction, but is that a step too far? Should Devolution be scrapped or should it be reformed? If it is to be reformed we have to ask: reformed into what? And what actions would need to be taken to reform it? Is it salvageable? Or will it inevitably tend towards separation? Whatever the case, the UK Government needs to affirm its authority. At a minimum, it should stop any further calls for referenda, not just on the grounds that ‘once in a generation’ actually means once in a real generation -- not a pretendy one -- but that it will not countenance any vote that means the break up of the UK. The UK Government must, primarily, be a protector of its own territory, and act in the best interests of all its citizens, not just a small percentage of separatists. Secondly, there must be more oversight. Inquiries into devolved government misspending and scandals must be conducted at the UK level, and have the threat of proper punishments and penalties. Thirdly, there must be less centralisation and duplication of UK facilities. Devolution was set up as an Assembly, not a Government. The UK Government should aim to harmonise our taxation, economy and laws, and resotre power to local authorities. And if it is to be abolished, we have to ask: abolished into what? While the idea of turning Holyrood into a car park and getting rid of the constant calls for Separation is a seductive one, what would be the reality of the situation? A restoration of power and funding to local authorities would be welcome, but what of ‘Scotland-only’ issues? Could they be dealt with by our existing 50 MPs? Our choices are therefore: Continue with the status quo The SNP will continue in power and keep agitating for a second referendum. We rely on the UK Government to hold the line until the next General Election. 2. Beat the SNP at the polls\u0026nbsp; As we all know, the SNP is only in power because the opposition parties are divided. We need a one-time alliance to break the back of the Nationalists. The main parties should stop their opposition to this idea. It directly benefits them. If they don’t, they will suffer at the polling booth in 2021. The majority want and need them to step up. 3. Abolish the Parliament This might be a cleaner solution, but at this stage it is probably a step too far for mainstream voters. However, never underestimate the power of the ‘fuck-you’ vote. Indeed, a large part of the SNP’s vote comes from exactly that feeling of protest, directed against the UK, so would it be any surprise if anti-Nationalists harnessed the same kind of sentiment against the SNP? Johnson may have ignited the debate, but this fire will continue to burn until someone has the nerve to stamp it out.","date":"2020-11-18","summary":"Whether you like, or even agree with, Boris Johnson or not, he has done us all a huge favour by igniting a discussion on whether Devolution is a \u0027disa..."},{"title":"Why I\u0027m Not A \\","url":"/articles/why-im-not-a-unionist/","content":"One of the main techniques extremist groups like Nationalists use to make themselves appear normal is to label their opponents something they would like them to be and then attack that label. By labelling their opponents as “Unionists” or “Yoons” they associate them with Union Jacks, British bulldogs, Churchill, and The Queen. (Of course the Union that the Nationalists almost always imagine is English — they never include Northern Ireland or Wales, or the Scottish people who are part of Britain.) But irrespective of whether you think Churchill or the Queen are good, the labelling achieves several things: It forces you to defend “The Union” (and sadly, many of us have fallen into this trap)It alienates people who don’t identify with “The Union” (mainly Labour supporters)It reduces the complexity of Britain, from Devon to Dunfermline, from Birmingham to Bathgate, to a single legal document that Nationalists believe can be repealed easily.And it attempts to split people into two equal and opposing camps: Nationalists and Unionists: A fight between two extremes (and yours is worse!) Nationalists call you a Unionist so that you will defend the Union and they can attack you. Like most people, I don’t care that much about “the Union”. I’m certainly not going to wave a Union Flag around. But, like most people,\u0026nbsp;I do care what actual flag-waving Nationalists are doing to Scotland. They are choosing the battleground and the weapons to beat you. So\u0026nbsp;stop trying to defend the Union.\u0026nbsp; For example, Fascists try to call those who are against them “communists” because it’s easy to understand and easy to attack. But most people who are against Fascism aren’t communists. They are just ordinary folk. But Mark, I hear you say, what am I if I am against the ugly cult of Nationalism? Glad you asked. It’s simple:\u0026nbsp;You’re an\u0026nbsp;anti-Nationalist.\u0026nbsp; You see the difference? A person who accepts being called “a Unionist” has to defend \u0026nbsp;the union. An\u0026nbsp;anti-Nationalist\u0026nbsp;takes the fight back to the Nationalists.\u0026nbsp;All decent people\u0026nbsp;should be against a dirty ideology that, wherever it raises its head, promotes bigotry, racism and stupidity. Let’s choose the battlefield and use better weapons. I don’t care what political affiliation you are. For now we can agree to disagree. But we can all agree that Nationalism is an ugly ideology that is bad for Scotland. Mark Devlin -- Publisher, The Majority Help us fight back In less than a year there\u0027s going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nicola Sturgeon and her cronies will use it to keep calling us \u0027Unionists\u0027, \u0027Red Tories\u0027 and \u0027British Nationalists\u0027, while they sow further division and continue to agitate for a disastrous referendum.

In the European elections in May 2019, the party slumped to fifth in Scotland, polling less than 10% of the vote. The party then fell from seven seats to one in November’s General Election. A YouGov poll for The Times puts support for Labour at 14 per cent in Holyrood’s constituency and list vote. And 53 percent of voters could not recognise Mr Leonard. We present a timeline of the people calling for Leonard\u0027s resignation, with our thoughts on what his replacement must do to beat the toxic Nationalism that has engulfed Scotland. June 28 George Foulkes, Labour peer, says Leonard must go: He has to put the interests of the Labour party in Scotland ahead of his own personal interests. He doesn’t seem to like it and he doesn’t seem to break through. needs to think of what is best for the party in terms of the Holyrood elections. Tony Blair has sent a coded message to him and he needs to think carefully about it. July 8 In The Majority’s highly unscientific Twitter poll, 84% of 930 respondents say Leonard should be replaced. There are also a number of comments, like this one, from Nationalists who want to keep him: https://twitter.com/helendc1esq/status/1280922746323636227 July 30 Jackson Carlaw quits as leader of The Scottish Conservatives: simply believe that a new leader will be able, as we recover from the Covid-19 emergency, to make the case for the Scottish Conservatives and The Union better than me. That is all that matters. July 30 Archie Macpherson calls on ‘invisible’ Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard to quit ‘nostalgic cult’ party I doubt if anybody interested in the future of the Labour Party in Scotland, and indeed in the continuance of the UK as we know it, could disagree with George Foulkes...that it is time for Richard Leonard to step down from a leadership that is edging his party towards utter irrelevance. August 30 A delegation of Labour MSPs tell Leonard he should go, or face ‘election disaster’. September 1 Journalist, Stephen Daisley, who has argued for some time that\u0026nbsp; Leonard isn’t up to the job, says he should go: But while he has managed a few decent turns against Nicola Sturgeon at First Minister’s Questions, his tenure has been what I call a ghost leadership. There is no memorable speech, policy proposal or campaign to his name. If he went tomorrow, he would leave so little trace that you would soon wonder if he had been there at all. James Kelly MSP, Scottish Labour’s Shadow Justice Spokesperson, resigns, saying: More than half of the public have no opinion on you and you have a negative rating even among our own supporters. Such poor ratings could produce a catastrophic result from which the party would struggle to recover. Coming a poor third in the election would be letting down those who rely on Scottish Labour to provide a strong voice. I see no evidence of a clear plan to reverse the party’s fortunes. The situation has been apparent for some time and you have failed to turn things around. I have no confidence in your ability to shape the party’s message, strategy and organisation. https://twitter.com/JamesKellyLab/status/1301054516213755904 Supported by Jane Marra MSP: If we do not change course now we risk catastrophe. Not just for the party but for all those who believe in and need a fairer, more equal Scotland. After three years the party’s standing is getting worse rather than better. No one can say that Richard has not had opportunities to turn the situation around. Colleagues know that is utterly committed to the party, the cause and he is liked by everyone. But the job we are asked to do by the party is not to let sentiment stop us from acting when all the evidence and our duty demands that we act. Richard is a stalwart of our party but he cannot lead us. That’s the unavoidable truth and change is our best hope. And Daniel Johnson MSP: https://twitter.com/DJohnsonMSP/status/1301057135506329601 September 2 Mark Griffin resigns as Shadow Social Security spokesperson: We cannot hope to improve when any criticism, public or private, is dismissed as factional. I have had grave concerns about the future of the Scottish Labour Party for some time, especially following the disastrous European and General Election results. September 3 Labour front-bencher, Rachel Reeves, calls for Leonard to \u0027consider his position\u0027: The opinion polls in Scotland are pretty dire for Labour, we\u0027ve got important elections next year. consider his position and do what he thinks is right for Scotland and for Scottish Labour. Helen Liddell, Meta Ramsay, George Robertson and George Foulkes write a letter to Leonard. https://twitter.com/nickeardleybbc/status/1301529370281095169 Leonard: They elected me back in 2017 to lead the Scottish Labour Party into the May 2021 Scottish Parliament elections; that is what I am on course to doing. a huge number of messages of support from right across the party, the trade unions...I am confident I have got the backing of the members of the Scottish Labour Party, who elected me just under three years ago. The Majority’s view It’s not enough that Leonard must go, his successor must fight effectively against Nationalism. This should be a straightforward ideological battle: Labour, of all parties, should realise that their real enemy in Scotland is not the Tories, but a divisive Nationalism that steals their natural supporters with fake promises. Nationalism is fake socialism.\u0026nbsp;Nationalism and socialism are simply incompatible. You cannot claim to be a socialist while supporting a party that causes division based on nationality. You cannot claim to be a socialist while wanting to deprive Scots of the shared finances and social services of the United Kingdom. You cannot claim to be a socialist and want to impoverish the poor for a selfish dream. You cannot be for equality when you wish to make foreigners of fellow workers in the rest of the UK. It\u0027s time to assert yourselves as real socialists and anti-Nationalists, and reject the Red Tory label. And finally, make alliances with anyone to get rid of this ugly and divisive ideology from Scotland.

Campbell had previously said that he had retired, but this apparently, is the ‘last, last’ time. To signify the end of the independence movement, Campbell used a somewhat laboured metaphor of the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont in December 1969, which, due to a murder of an audience member by Hell\u0027s Angels, signalled the end of the swinging 60s. Apparently, Sturgeon is a Hell’s Angel, stabbing the \u0027peace and love\u0027 of the indy movement to death, while the Stones play ‘Under My Thumb’! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRQaqmP7QGY The article is full of juicy observations on the state of a movement that isn’t going anywhere (see below), all salted by the delicious irony that Campbell encouraged the chaos he now sees before him. Like many Nationalists, he is appalled at the fire, but fails to remember that he rejoiced in pouring petrol on it. It should be no surprise that when you vote for Nationalism, you get Nationalism in all its glory. When you turn a blind eye to declining services, scandals, financial impropriety, criminal acts, persecution of rivals, centralisation of power, cult-like behavior, and slavish leader worship, all for the ‘cause of the nation’, then you really do get the Government you deserve. When you continue to enable their bad behaviour by voting for them, despite all that, they know they can get away with it and it just gets worse and worse. Sadly, the rest of us, who can see through this charade, who can see through cynical politicians gaining power and money while treating their followers as mugs, and treating the rest of us as collateral damage, don’t deserve it. One can only hope that one day the Reverend will understand his role and repent. RIP Wings: 2013-2021. We won’t miss you. From the article... There is no \"independence movement\" any more, just an independence industry. It provides a very lucrative living for perhaps a couple of hundred people – SNP MPs, MSPs, party staff and apparatchiks, special advisers, quango heads and favoured civil servants lavishly rewarded for their personal loyalty to Nicola Sturgeon despite track records of incompetence, bungling and impropriety that have cost taxpayers a vast fortune. The SNP, and in practice the wider Yes movement, is now firmly under the thumb of Sturgeon and her tiny closed cabal. The members’ influence on the party has been systematically shredded to the point where they’re now a rubber-stamp at best. In embarking on a desperately-escalating attempt to silence her predecessor, motivated by baseless paranoia, Sturgeon revealed her true self: a power-crazed careerist prepared to throw under the bus anything and anyone that might threaten her grip on the keys to Bute House. If there’s ever another independence referendum – and we see no prospect of one in the next decade at least – Sturgeon and her Green hench will already have turned Scotland into a grotesque, intolerant, science-denying authoritarian hell, where all protest is deemed a hate crime and biological women are third-class citizens forbidden from mentioning the fact of their own sex. £884,841 Last weekend marked seven years since the indyref – the period effectively stipulated as a \"generation\"...by the Good Friday Agreement . That the SNP, which held another stage-managed fake online “conference” this month, hasn’t bothered with even a token attempt to highlight this significant fact in a full week, let alone take any action over it, tells you everything about the party’s current attitude towards independence. Meanwhile, among those who are still actively focused on independence an alarming number of people are openly calling for a blood-and-soil voting franchise should another indyref ever happen, a truly terrible idea I want no part of. A section of the movement appears to be retreating into kilts-and-bagpipes-and-Gaelic cultural nationalism...that predated the SNP’s electoral success and gives the average voter the pure heebs every bit as much as Sturgeon’s rainbow-haired sturmjugend do. Independence would also bankrupt the SNP, which is currently wholly dependent on Westminster money to balance its books. Even with that Short Money the party is wildly profligate and has totally inadequate reserves with which to fight a referendum\u0027. What the party HAS focused on, and largely achieved, is to ruthlessly crush the non-SNP indy movement by constantly attacking and undermining it. The Hope Over Fear rally in Glasgow a week ago drew less than a couple of hundred people where it used to get thousands. A showpiece \"debate\" in Edinburgh this week was an impossibly depressing affair. And if we’re talking about embarrassing, the state of The National is making us long for the days when there were no pro-indy newspapers. We agree: If you haven\u0027t already, please sign and share our petition to urge Newsquest and Gannett to stop publishing The National\u0027s anti-English hate. The SNP now has the Yes movement exactly where it wants it – dispirited, apathetic and divided, with nowhere to put its faint and battered hopes but a centrist neoliberal party which is safely ensconced at both Westminster and Holyrood. with no elections due for years, and is far more interested in consolidating its own power, and the cult of identity politics and Queer Theory, than in independence. In the comments, the Reverend responded to this comment... Everyone who supports Scottish independence has some vague notion of Scottishness that they think is important enough to warrant distinction and important enough to pursue politically. Otherwise, what’s the point? ..with his motivation... I don\u0027t. I think we’re a country, marked by a line on a map like every other country, and that fact in and of itself should mean we’re entitled to choose our own governments. No more and no less.Are lines on maps arbitrary? Perhaps, but they’re how we’ve organised the world for millennia and until such times as we have a one-world government they’re what we’ve got. Years of blogging, years of division. So many wasted years. All for an arbitrary ‘line on a map\u0027.
