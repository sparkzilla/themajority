Found the image for the "Independence Is Dead" article.

**Image location:**
- File path: `static\images\posts\Independence-is-dead-1200x600.jpg`
- The image file exists in your static folder

**Current status:**
The article file (`content/posts/independence-is-dead.md`) doesn't have a `featuredImage` field in its front matter. Other articles (like "It's a Love Story, Baby just say Yes") use `featuredImage = "images/posts/..."` in the front matter.

Should I add the `featuredImage` field to the article's front matter so it displays properly? The path would be:
```
featuredImage = "images/posts/Independence-is-dead-1200x600.jpg"
```
