Added the script tag to the sidebar. It’s now in `themes/majority/layouts/partials/sidebar.html` inside the `sidebar-content` div, so it will appear on all pages that use the sidebar partial.

The email form script will load asynchronously and display in the sidebar when the site is built and deployed.

Added a social media panel above the email form script in the sidebar.

**What I added:**
1. **Social Media Panel** with three icons:
   - **X (Twitter)**: Links to `https://twitter.com/themajorityscot`
   - **Facebook**: Links to `https://www.facebook.com/themajorityscot/`
   - **YouTube**: Links to `https://www.youtube.com/c/themajorityscot`

2. **Styling**:
   - Panel with border and rounded corners
   - Circular icons with light gray background
   - Hover effects: icons turn blue with a subtle lift and shadow
   - Icons are centered and evenly spaced

The panel appears above the email form script in the sidebar on all pages. Icons use SVG for crisp rendering and include accessibility attributes.

Updated the social media panel:

1. **Bigger icons**: Increased from 44px to 56px (SVG from 24px to 32px)
2. **App colors**: Icons use the primary blue (#0085C2)
3. **Border around panel**: Added a 2px primary blue border
4. **Even spacing**: Using `justify-content: space-between` to distribute icons evenly across the panel width

Icons are larger, use the primary blue, and are evenly spaced within the bordered panel.

Added "Follow us..." text above the icons inside the container.

**Changes made:**
1. Added a "Follow us..." heading above the icons
2. Wrapped the icons in a container for layout
3. Updated CSS:
   - Panel uses `flex-direction: column` to stack title and icons
   - Title styled in primary blue (#0085C2) with Fira Sans
   - Icons remain evenly spaced using `space-between`

The panel now shows "Follow us..." at the top, with the three social media icons evenly spaced below it, all within the bordered container.

Made both changes:

1. **Thinner border**: Changed the social media panel border from `2px` to `1px`.
2. **Padding below email form**: Wrapped the email form script in a container div and added `20px` padding-bottom.

The border is thinner, and there's now 20px of space below the email input box.

Updated the social media panel border to match the email input box.

**Changes made:**
1. Changed the social media panel border from `var(--primary-blue)` (blue) to `var(--border-color)` (light gray `#e0e0e0`) to match the email form input box
2. Added CSS to style the email form inputs to ensure consistent border styling
3. Removed the duplicate definition

Both the social media panel and the email input box now use the same light gray border (`1px solid var(--border-color)`).
