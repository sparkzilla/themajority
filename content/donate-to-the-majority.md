## Help us fundraise for 2025

The Majority is entirely supported by your donations. Over the past two years, hundreds of donors have helped fund our billboard and ad van campaigns; our Youth Outreach Program; the setup and running costs of The Majority Show; social media campaigns; and general running costs for The Majority team to work on all of these projects and plan for new ones.

While we love any type of donation, if you are able, we would like you to consider pledging a monthly donation so that we can amplify your voice in 2024. Regular amounts every month from many donors gives us the stability to work on long-term projects.

We use Donorbox to handle all donations. Their system allows you to set up monthly amounts and pause and cancel when you wish. If you need help, or have any problems with your donation, please contact us directly at [info@themajority.scot](mailto:info@themajority.scot)
