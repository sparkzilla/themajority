<p>I have never, under any leader, felt more positive about our chances of winning the next Holyrood Election.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe Douglas Ross is a political nuclear weapon that can not only strike fear into the Scottish National Party, but can stabilise this country financially and restore the power to the people, from a centralist Government in Edinburgh.</p>



<p>Living in South Lanarkshire, for me, Edinburgh often feels 550 miles away from home, while London feels 30 miles away. Holyrood and the devolution settlement, to this day, has been a complete failure. Tony Blair destroyed our United Kingdom’s unity by handing the Scottish Nationalists a parliament to breed dissent and grievance in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of intervening and regulating the devolved government, all UK governments, post-devolution, have failed to see the division that many politicians sent to the devolved chambers were spreading. They have allowed voters to believe that a party with the word “national” in their name, were the only ones who truly cared about Scotland. They have portrayed Conservatives as imperial masters holding them in some kind of horrific jail cell, that drains Scotland of wealth and prosperity, when the complete opposite is true.</p>



<p>I am proud of our United Kingdom in every single possible way. We live in the greatest country in the world. To destroy it would be cutting our nose off to spite our face. I am also proud of Scotland, and know we can do so much better than what we have now.</p>



<p>Douglas grew up in Moray, born into a dairy farming family. He studied and worked in agriculture before getting involved in Scottish Politics as a researcher at the Scottish Parliament. He stood in a variety of Holyrood and Westminster elections as a Conservative, before finally being elected as MSP for Highlands and Islands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, he stood as an MP and ousted the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, pulling 16% of the vote share from beneath him. He then went on to secure the seat again in the 2019 General Election.</p>



<p>Viewed as “one to watch” he secured a position as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. However, as a protest at Boris Johnston’s defence of Dominic Cummings, against the Prime Minister’s wishes, Douglas resigned from his position in Government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, at the age of only 37, he has returned to the fold, and is taking on the mammoth task of defending the Union in Scotland and plans on ousting Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister of Scotland in the Scottish Parliamentary Elections of May 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can he do it? Of course he can.</p>



<p>Douglas’s background, ethics, morals and vision for our country matters abundantly more to the voters I speak to on the doorsteps, than putting our country through another decade of constitutional arguments and friction between our two governments. He can, and will, unite the anti-Nationalist vote (Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative) to pull Nicola Sturgeon off her cloud.</p>



<p>I have never been so upbeat about our Party’s prospects. We have a leader with a clear vision, a young vision and a true desire to unite our people, to stop the grievance and get on with governing Scotland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Douglas Ross is the man to send Nicola Sturgeon packing and that is why I unequivocally back him to lead my party and my country.</p>
