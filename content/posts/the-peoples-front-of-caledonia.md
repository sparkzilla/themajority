<p><strong>The Scexit File</strong>s: <em>The Spectator, </em>10<sup>th</sup> April 2021</p>



<p>At a tense briefing yesterday, SNP sources strenuously denied that any detergent was used to enforce ideological purity during the ongoing Sturgeonista-Salmondite split. The allegation emerged after a recording of a recent internal strategy meeting was obtained by <em>The Spectator</em>. </p>



<p>An extract has now been published below in the public interest. (Identities have been amended for legal reasons).&nbsp;</p>



<p>IAN: “TRAITORS!”</p>



<p>RUTH: “The Salmondite front is a total irrelevance now. We must focus on our campaigning as planned…”</p>



<p>CONVENER: “Exactly…we need to get Scotland’s floating voters to question why we are still chained to the UK.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>IAN: “…I mean, what have the British <em>ever</em> done for us?”</p>



<p>RUTH: “That’s right…<em>nada</em>, nuttin’, nought…”</p>



<p>JEAN: “Aye…it’s a big zero…except vaccines, of course.”</p>



<p>RUTH: “Bloody, sharp pointy things.”</p>



<p>CONVENER: “Well…yes…there’s vaccines…but…”</p>



<p>JIM: “…and the NHS…”</p>



<p>ANDY: “…plus border-free trade, of course.”</p>



<p>CONVENER: “Yeah-yeah…ok…but apart from vaccines, the NHS and border-free…”</p>



<p>JOHN: “The pound – it’s Scotland’s too, remember.”</p>



<p>JEAN: “Too right…we need all the dosh we can get.”</p>



<p>ANDY: “And we get membership of the UN Security Council…”</p>



<p>CONVENER: “Pffah!! BLOODY bourgeois talking shop…”</p>



<p>PETER: “…then there’s Darwin, Newton…”</p>



<p>KATE: “…David Attenborough…”</p>



<p>AHMED: “Yeah…and how about David Jason? I used to watch <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> and <em>Dad’s Army </em>too…they were great…”</p>



<p>PETER: “…and <em>Monty Python</em>…it’s an absolute classic.”</p>



<p>KATE: “Don’t forget <em>The Beano</em>, eh?”</p>



<p>CONVENER: “<strong>HEY!!</strong> That’s <em>Scottish!</em>”</p>



<p>BRIAN: “ …but…well…aren’t Scottish sort of British too…”</p>



<p>CONVENER: “<strong>WHAT?!!!</strong>”</p>



<p>RUTH: “Wash out your mouth with <em>Fairy Liquid</em>…”</p>



<p>BRIAN: “Well…y’see…that's<em> </em>a great British brand…”</p>



<p>CONVENER: “GET HIM…”</p>



<p>RUTH: “…give him a GLASGOW KISS…”</p>







<p>Lawyers have issued a statement claiming that the organisation was infiltrated by agent-provocateurs. Speaking off the record, sources were more blunt: “We’re gonna ☠????☠⭍ ! the <em>Salmondite Front of Caledonia!</em> They’re WORSE than the British!”</p>
