<p>UPDATE: Our billboard campaign has been delayed. Apparently, the billboard company have a new policy that means direct criticism of political parties is not allowed (despite that being fine last year). We're submitting redesigned ads now.</p>



<p>UPDATE 2: We changed to a different company and the ads are now running, without any text changes</p>

<p>Today, <strong>The Majority</strong>, with the support of donors who contributed to its crowdfunding campaign, launches the <strong>SNP COUNCILS ARE RUBBISH</strong> <strong>#BinTheSNP</strong> campaign for the upcoming  Scottish Council Elections on May 5. The campaign includes digital billboards in Glasgow, Edinburgh and, Aberdeen (see locations/dates below).</p>



<p>The campaign message — <strong>SNP COUNCILS ARE RUBBISH</strong> — highlights the failure of SNP councils to deal with basic issues on voters' doorsteps. Voters have seen increases in fly-tipping, delayed and extended rubbish collection periods, rat infestations and unfilled potholes, while SNP councillors are preoccupied calling for a second referendum. The image shows a rubbish-strewn street inhabited by two rats.</p>



<p>The campaign hashtag— <strong>#BinTheSNP</strong>— is part of an ongoing grassroots hashtag campaign on Twitter that has had hundreds of retweets and responses.</p>



<p>The campaign is funded by donations to a crowdfunder, run by The Majority, that has raised over £3300 from its donors to date. As more donations come in, the campaign may be expanded.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The majority of Scots are angry and frustrated by the SNP’s woeful record in local Government. SNP councils won’t fight cuts by Nicola Sturgeon’s administration, and their focus on a second referendum means our roads, bin collections and basic services are a disaster. The Scottish public deserves councillors who will concentrate on local services, not be distracted by campaigning for a referendum that will never happen.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
