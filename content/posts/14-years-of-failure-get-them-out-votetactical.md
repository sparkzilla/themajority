<p>Today, <strong>The Majority</strong>, with the support of almost 600 donors who raised £14,500 for their <em>Let’s Put Up Billboards!</em> crowdfunding campaign, launches its final elections campaign, before the Scottish Elections on May 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a hugely successful campaign that flew a #ResignSturgeon banner over Holyrood, and took ‘We Don't Believe You NIcola’ ad vans to the Scotttish Parliament, The Majority now takes the fight directly to the Scottish people, via billboards and mobile digital ad vans carrying a message highlighting 14 Years of SNP failure and promoting tactical voting:</p>



<ul><li>A two-week digital billboard campaign, starting April 19th, includes digital billboards in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee</li><li>Mobile ad vans that will visit constituencies in Glasgow, Central region, Edinburgh and Fife that can be won from the SNP through tactical voting, plus Nicola Sturgeon’s constituency. See schedule below).</li></ul>



<p>This campaign aims to let voters know that they have the power to use tactical voting to put an end to 14 years of SNP failure. Research by Scotland Matters shows that up to 500,000 Scottish voters are considering tactical voting. We invite various campaign groups to take advantage of the #VoteTactical hashtag on Twitter.</p>



<p>Mark Devlin, founder of the Majority:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In this election, ordinary people have the power to put an end to 14 Years of SNP incompetence, corruption, and failure by voting tactically. The SNP is only in power because the opposition support is split. We urge ordinary people to use the power of their vote to support the best candidate to beat the SNP, regardless of their usual party affiliation. This could lead to up to 30 more pro-UK seats, and more importantly, 30 less SNP seats.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ad van schedule:</p>
