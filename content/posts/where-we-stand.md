<p>In modern-day Scotland, we see:</p>



<ul><li>A country unnecessarily divided as Nationalist leaders promote division to boost their own power&nbsp;</li><li>Our friends and neighbours entranced by <strong>ugly Nationalism</strong> and influenced daily by dishonest propaganda churned out by the Nationalist establishment</li><li>Politicians who always put their immature dreams above the welfare of the people</li><li>A looming one-party state where unsuitable and incompetent people are promoted based on party loyalty</li><li>An ineffective and divided opposition</li><li>Leaders who casually dismiss the vote of the majority</li></ul>



<p>And we see the <strong>silent majority</strong> of Scots cowed into silence and ignored by the government and the media.</p>



<p><em>The Majority</em> exists to:</p>



<ul><li>Give Scotland's anti-Nationalist majority a voice</li><li>Unite anyone, whether they are in a political party or not, who is against Nationalism</li><li>Attack Nationalism as an ideology <em>that has no place in Scotland</em>, or the world</li><li>Reveal Nationalist thinking as it is: ugly, bigoted, divisive, and immature</li><li>Expose the charlatans who use Nationalist ideology to gain power</li><li>Link the policies and performance of Nationalist politicians to Nationalist traits: <ul><li>supremacism</li><li>inferiority complex</li><li>grievance</li><li>bigotry/racism</li><li>centralised control</li><li>worship of the state</li><li>acceptance of a one-party state</li><li>leader worship</li><li>fanaticism</li><li>groupthink</li><li>and censorship</li></ul></li><li>Help people understand this is a battle fought with psychology and language</li><li>Stop Nationalists defining us by breaking their narratives, slurs and propaganda: We are not Unionists, Red Tories or British Nationalists: We are simply <em><u><strong>anti-Nationalists</strong></u></em></li><li>Stop being defensive and take the fight back to the Nationalists. </li><li>Give people easy-to-share content to fight back against Nationalist tropes</li><li>Challenge politicians and the media to do what is right and fight back against Nationalism</li><li>Enjoy this fight. <a href="https://themajority.scot/2020/06/26/be-the-pig-a-primer-on-how-to-fight-nationalists/">Be the pig!</a></li></ul>



<p>The fight back accelerates from here, and we thank you all for your support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You are not alone. We have a voice.<strong> <u>We are The Majority.</u></strong></p>
