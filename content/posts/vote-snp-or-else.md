<p>In my last commentary for <em>The Majority</em>, I spoke about how the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon, in particular, treat us — the Scottish electorate — as nothing more than <a href="https://themajority.scot/2020/12/02/sturgeons-stepping-stones/">stepping stones</a> towards the realisation of their immature, teenage dreams. </p>



<p>There is nothing, and no one, they would not sacrifice, take advantage of, exploit or attack in this all-encompassing obsession. An obsession that has divided our country, communities and families for the last decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also commented that their schemes — always accompanied by massive amounts of publicity — always collapse when their poorly planned, and even more poorly executed ideas, face the harsh light of the real world.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I was thinking about these projects and the untold burdens that they placed on our lives, our futures and our communities, when I finally realised that the SNP's <em>modus operandi</em> is to hold us hostage and to ransom us to a future that is as poorly planned as all their other ventures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A prime example is the now-deleted Tweet sent by Angus MacNeil, the MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (formerly known as the Western Isles), on September 3rd, 2019.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/AngusMacNeil-Hostage-Tweet.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8034"/></figure>



<p>MacNeil threatens to make Scottish Government support for a charity that strives to combat Scotland's tragically high drug death rate, which at the time of the tweet's writing, was the highest in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-48938509">Europe</a>, contingent on its support for breaking up the United Kingdom. </p>



<p>He is holding hostage those who care for some of the most vulnerable people in our community by threatening to allow the drug epidemic to go unaided unless we bend the knee and fall in line with him and his party's objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first time we have seen such actions by the SNP; in fact, it has become common in their manner of government to use intimidation, neglect and favouritism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January of this year, John Mason MSP for Glasgow Shettleston, had this to say on Twitter, "<a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18164963.snp-msp-urged-quit-refusing-speak-unionist-constituents/">I will not be speaking up for constituents who want lower taxes, orange marches, keeping Scotland in the UK, etc</a>." Again, we see how the SNP disregards the very people they are sworn to represent because we do not share their opinions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all the promises of a golden future that “independence” would supposedly bring us, the SNP are holding us, the Scottish electorate, hostage until we simply roll over and give in to their demands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/tories-accuse-snp-sitting-ps22bn-war-chest-ahead-election-3055769">hoarding billions of pounds</a> of UK taxpayer money intended for businesses so that they can use it for cheap political stunts, like the £500 NHS workers bonus, in the run-up to the 2021 election. Meanwhile, a comedy club business run by Tommy Sheppard, an SNP MP, has <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-in-scotland-groups-linked-to-the-super-rich-pocket-thousands-in-covid-cash-mzp8rbg32">received more than £300,000</a> of taxpayer-funded support, while hundreds of more deserving businesses are denied.</p>



<p>This shameful abuse of power cannot be allowed to continue; we cannot remain the hostages of a government hell bent on its divisive and poorly planned fever dreams. We must resist these captors and call out their underhanded and bullying, brutish behaviour; we must demand representation by people who will actually represent us and our needs, and we must be steadfast in our commitment to solidarity rather than separation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SNP claim they act in the interests of Scotland; they daily proclaim to speak in our name, but they don't represent us, the majority of the electorate, who see them for what they are and who are disgusted by their corruption.</p>



<p>I will never be their hostage. We must all act to rid our country of these charlatans who would feed us poison only to profit from the antidote. </p>
