<p>The campaign is a simple and direct message to Nicola Sturgeon to take responsibility for her catastrophic handling of the Scottish Government.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While the majority of Scots want the Scottish Government to focus on the cost-of-living crisis, energy bills and a failing health service, Nicola Sturgeon has spent the past eight years dividing Scots, promoting Green extremists to government, and picking unnecessary and costly fights with Westminster. Her Gender Reform Bill is just the latest example of how out of touch she is with ordinary Scottish people’s priorities. Instead of putting rapists into female prisons, she must resign so the country can move on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A Panelbase/SundayTimes poll from Feb 11 indicated that 40% of Scots want Nicola Sturgeon to resign now , including a growing number of her own supporters. Scots overwhelmingly do not want trans-identifying males to have access to women’s prisons .</p>



<p>The campaign message — <strong>#ResignSturgeon </strong>— is part of an ongoing grassroots hashtag campaign on Twitter that has had hundreds of thousands of retweets and responses and regularly appears on Twitter’s ‘trending’ lists of the social network’s most popular hashtags.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The campaign is funded wholly by donations to a crowdfunder, run by The Majority, that has raised almost £5600 to date. Funds that come in after the billboards are displayed will be used to promote the campaign on social media. The crowdfunder is here: <a href="https://donorbox.org/resignsturgeonbillboards">https://donorbox.org/resignsturgeonbillboards</a></p>



<p>The Majority's&nbsp; #ResignSturgeon billboard campaigns and aerial banner for the 2021 Scottish Elections were seen by hundreds of thousands of Scots and featured in over 70 newspapers worldwide.</p>
