<p>It’s difficult to believe that it’s only been four months since I started the Majority. At the time, I was amazed that there was no media that represented us, the silent majority of anti-Nationalists in Scotland.</p>



<p>In four months, thanks to your support, The Majority has grown to over <a href="https://twitter.com/themajorityscot">8000 Twitter followers</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/themajorityscot/">2500 Facebook fans</a>, our articles have been read over 200,000 times and hundreds of thousands of you have watched our videos and memes. Some highlights:</p>

<p>We've also been <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/politics/scottish-politics/1521067/online-politics-digital-landscape/">featured in the <em>Dundee Courier</em></a> and had mentions in The Times.</p>



<p><strong>But there’s still a lot more to do. </strong></p>



<p>Every year our opponents are pouring over a million pounds into The National and to Wings Over Scotland, promoting ugly Nationalist propaganda, grievance and lies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our newspapers are weak. They’re so scared of losing Nationalist readers, they hire columnists who always want to compromise. Let’s give the Separatists more concessions! Let’s try some new-fangled constitutional solution!</p>



<p><strong>But appeasing Separatists never works.</strong></p>



<p>The simple fact is the majority won the 2014 referendum, and winners don’t need to appease. We need our own media that will say no to indyref2, support anti-Nationalist politicians, and will push to end the tired and ugly Nationalism that has infected Scotland.</p>



<p><strong>I can do a lot more. </strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sparkzilla/">Check my LinkedIn</a>. I founded <a href="http://japantoday.com">japantoday.com</a>, one of the world’s largest news sites and had a staff of 40 people. I can build The Majority into a full anti-Nationalist media that can rival The National and reach the vast majority of ordinary Scots who are appalled at the state of our country. But I need your help to do it.</p>



<p>Right now, thanks to our donors, we currently have £1000 pounds a month in recurring donations (actually £981.29). If I can get that up to £2500 pounds a month I can give up my other work and do this full time, as well as pay for running costs. As we get beyond that I can start to hire people and build a team that can turn the tide against the Nationalists.</p>



<p>I know times are tough for many of you, but if you can, please pledge whatever you can afford. Even £6 or £10 a month — less than the price of a cup of coffee a week — can make a big difference. </p>



<p>(If you are a corporate donor, I hope you can donate £100 or £50 a month, a tiny amount compared to the costs of business distruption that would happen in a disastrous Separation).</p>



<p><strong>Let’s get into a strong position by the end of the year, and head into the election with The Majority, amplifying all our voices.</strong></p>



<p>Thank you all for your support.&nbsp;</p>
