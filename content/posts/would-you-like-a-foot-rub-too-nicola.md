<p>When will the opposition parties in Scotland learn to fight? Today I was appalled to see yet another weak and compliant message from Jackson Carlaw, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, praising the Nationalists for their response to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This comes on the heels of an earlier tweet where he did the same:</p>

<p>Confidence in the First Minister? W.T.A.F.</p>



<p>Jackson, a wee clue: they are not your friends. They are Nationalists who are destroying our country. Every move they make, every breath they take, is designed to further their ugly Nationalist goal of separation. Everything they do causes division.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not like you don’t have material. Nicola Sturgeon's COVID response has been awful. She let hundreds of people die in care homes. She covered up the early Nike outbreak. She’s grandstanded all over the TV for months, and in the past few days she’s managed to destroy the Scottish tourist industry with her border insanity.</p>



<p>But here you are, agreeing with her. Do you understand what <em>opposition </em>means?</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>to oppose</h2>



<p><em><strong>verb</strong></em></p>



<ol><li><strong>disagree with and attempt to prevent, especially by argument.</strong></li><li><strong>actively resist (a person or system).</strong></li><li><strong>compete with (someone)</strong></li></ol>
</div></div>



<p>Your job is not to praise them, but <em>to bury them.</em></p>



<p>Even if they were saints, which they most certainly are not, your job would be to question their holiness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That, I, someone who has barely been involved in politics for five minutes, appears to understand this better than you, a professional politician, speaks volumes.</p>



<p>I noticed that someone on Twitter tried to help you by saying you could try:</p>



<p><strong>While these changes are welcome, &lt;insert attack here&gt;</strong></p>



<p>But why even mention you agree? It’s not your job to do PR for Nationalists.</p>



<p>This is politics. It’s not a cosy club where you all give each other hearty backslaps and footrubs (or do you?) Nicola gets plenty of them from her followers. There is no need for you to join the line.</p>



<p>And this weakness is not exclusive to the Tories. Can anyone tell me, where is Labour’s invisible man? Richard Leonoard where are you? Hello?...Hello?</p>



<p>You’re supposed to be leaders. Stop being so weak and lead the fight.</p>



<p>If you can’t write effective tweets, hire someone who can. If you can’t get your messaging correct, hire advisors who can. If fighting is not your thing then, give the position to someone who relishes the task. </p>
