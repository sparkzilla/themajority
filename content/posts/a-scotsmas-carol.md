<p><strong>The Scexit Files </strong>:<strong> </strong>(<em>Scottish Review of Books,</em> 20th Dec. 2030)</p>



<p>“Bloody humbuggery!” muttered McScrooge as the lights flickered ominously. Rob McCratchit, his so-called ‘special advisor,’ had taken a day off and now – dammit – the Finance Minister had to write his own seasonal message.</p>



<p><em>‘Happy Scotsmas to one and all …’</em></p>



<p>Crivvens!! Stuck already. Where the hell was McCratchit when you really needed him? Sighing deeply, McScrooge rested his leaden head against the monitor until his thoughts drifted onto …</p>



<p>“Wakey-wakey!”</p>



<p>McScrooge jerked back to life.</p>



<p>“Fear not,” a gravelly voice intoned, giving his chains a shake. “I am the Ghost of Scotsmas Past, ready to show you the good ol’ days.”</p>



<p>And it was true. There on screen, a thousand cheering faces gazed upwards at his old campaign speech: “… and let us stuff it to the Westminster doom-mongers. Our time is bloody-well-now!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>McScrooge radiated pride. Happy days! A clear enemy – it made all the difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sweet, eh?” said the Ghost of Scotsmas Past. “All that power – without the pesky responsibility!”</p>



<p>McScrooge eased into a foggy glen of nostalgia till – with an almighty jolt – he was spooked by yet another spook.</p>



<p>“Yikes!!”</p>



<p>“You’ve guessed it!” the motherly voice intoned. “I am the Ghost of Scotsmas Present.”</p>



<p>“Ooh, a present!” gasped McScrooge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If only,” she smiled, tinkling her chains, “but let’s take a peek at how happily things are going now.”</p>



<p>McScrooge licked his lips. This would be good. There on screen, a hunched man scrolled though all his fiscal spreadsheets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“… and once we receive the IMF loan, it’ll all balance out,” he says to his nodding officials.</p>



<p>Silence.</p>



<p>“But Minister …” a wavering voice pipes up, “the loan has been t-t-turned down.”</p>



<p>Silence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We t-t-tried to negotiate, but we couldn’t persuade …”</p>



<p>“Couldn’t …” growls McScrooge “… or damn-well WOULDN’T.” The table shudders as his fist crashes down. “OUT!!” he yells. “OUT!! That’s an order!!”</p>



<p>Drenched in his own spittle, the livid minister turns to McCratchit. “T-t-t-t-traitors!” he stutters as his whole body crumples in defeat. “The budget is lost … LOST!!”</p>



<p>A ghostly hand rested on McScrooge’s shoulder as he gaped at the screen: “Independence. It’s what you always wanted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But you said happy.”</p>



<p>“Your dream came true,” replied the ghost. “Power with responsibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“B-but-but …” McScrooge stuttered, “… it’s the Westminster government … they’re up to their old tricks. After Indy, we offered them the hand of friendship, but they cut the funding during the transition discussions and even though we negotiated hard …”</p>



<p>The lights flickered. The ghostly apparition was fading, fainter and fainter until all that was left was “… zzzz …”</p>



<p>“For cryin’ out loud,” McScrooge wailed. “You’re supposed to be scaring me out of my wits and all you can do is snore.”</p>



<p>“HEY!” cried a piccolo voice, piercing through the air.</p>



<p>McScrooge blanched.</p>



<p>“Scotsmas Future here,” the teenage voice shrieked, jingling her chains like a rapper. “I’m bringin’ you all that happy time travel stuff.” </p>



<p>McScrooge looked up quizzically. “Happy? You mean, <em>really</em> happy?”</p>



<p>“See for yourself, mista.”</p>



<p>And she was right. There on screen, all those cheering faces were back again – thousands of patriots waving the Lion Rampant.</p>



<p>McScrooge almost risked a smile as he turned up the volume to hear their chants.</p>



<p>“Crooks and thieves, out-out-OUT!”</p>



<p>“They’re chasin’ you out of office,” noted the wee ghost, “right after Orkney and Shetland dumped you.”</p>



<p>McScrooge’s face sagged like his oil revenues.</p>



<p>“Deal with it, man,” the spooky voice suggested. “You got NO more power … and NO more responsibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lights died. Another electricity cut – more windmill maintenance issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep in darkness, McScrooge picked up the phone, jabbing at the number. “Bob, where the hell are you?” he barked. “Take ten days off,” McScrooge insisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ten days!” exclaimed Bob.</p>



<p>“Who cares?” McScrooge exclaimed. “In the end, it won’t be our responsibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At long last, a smile cracked across McScrooge’s face just in time to dash off his final Scotmas message.</p>



<p>“Happy humbuggery!!”</p>
