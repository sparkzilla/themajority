<p>Today, <strong>The Majority</strong>, with the support of Scotland Matters, UK Union Voice and over 250 donors who contributed to a crowdfunding campaign, launches the <strong>#ResignSturgeon</strong> campaign, the first in a series of campaigns leading up to the Scottish Elections on May 6. The campaign starts with:</p>



<ul><li>Three digital billboards<ul><li>Glasgow - Clydeside Expressway (access near Lidl on Castlebank St)</li><li>Edinburgh - Slateford Road (next to Jewson)</li><li>Aberdeen - Market Street (at Union Square)<br></li></ul></li><li>A #ResignSturgeon banner towed behind an aeroplane flying over:<ul><li> The Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood and Edinburgh City Centre<br>(Friday, 5th March: 12:45- 1:30pm)</li><li>Glasgow City Centre and Finnieston Crane area<br>(Friday, 5th March: 3pm-4pm) weather permitting</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The campaign is a message to Nicola Sturgeon to take responsibility for her Government’s catastrophic handling of the Alex Salmond Harassment Inquiry, which cost the taxpayer well over £500,000 in damages to Salmond plus hundreds of thousands of pounds more in Scottish Government legal fees, as well as the cost of the ongoing inquiry. </p>



<p>Nicola Sturgeon hasn’t taken responsibility. She has not fired anyone. The whole of Scotland is talking about her collusion, corruption and cover-up, instead of health, education and jobs. She must resign so the country can move on.</p>



<p>The campaign message — <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ResignSturgeon">#ResignSturgeon</a> </strong>— is part of an ongoing grassroots hashtag campaign on Twitter that has had hundreds of thousands of retweets and responses and regularly appears on Twitter’s ‘trending’ lists of the social network’s most popular hashtags.</p>



<p>The campaign is funded in part by donations to a crowdfunder, run by The Majority, that has raised almost £6500 to date. <a href="https://donorbox.org/billboard-campaign">https://donorbox.org/billboard-campaign</a></p>



<p>Mark Devlin of The Majority:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We represent the silent majority of people in Scotland, who are angry and frustrated by Nicola Sturgeon’s shenanigans bringing international shame on Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish public deserve a Parliament and First Minister above reproach and want the Scottish Government to focus on health, education, jobs and the pandemic. Instead we have a First Minister misleading parliament, breaking the ministerial code and withholding information from an inquiry into her government’s unlawful, unfair and biased actions against Alex Salmond, all while totally neglecting her day job.</p></blockquote>



<p>Alan Sutherland from Scotland Matters:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We call on the First Minister to do the right thing for Scotland: resign and let us focus on recovery from the pandemic. She has done great damage to our country and Parliament’s reputation, here and abroad, by conducting an undignified, very public dispute with her former SNP colleague, while preventing the Salmond enquiry from seeing evidence that is crucial to a proper investigation.</p></blockquote>
