<p>The United Kingdom faces a persistent challenge from separatist movements, particularly in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party (SNP) has pursued independence with unrelenting focus. Despite the intentions behind devolution, the existence of devolved legislatures like Holyrood has amplified the separatist agenda rather than diminished it. To secure the UK, a pragmatic dual strategy—a short-term defense and a long-term solution—is required.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Failure of Devolution to Quell Separatism</h3>



<p>When devolution was introduced, proponents like Labour politician George Robertson claimed it would "kill nationalism stone dead." Instead, the opposite has occurred. Over the past 26 years, Holyrood has provided the SNP with a powerful platform to dominate Scottish politics, displacing pro-UK parties like Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Far from reducing separatist sentiment, devolution has given the SNP a megaphone to advance their singular goal: breaking up the UK.</p>



<p>The SNP’s obsession with independence is clear in their governance record. Rather than focusing on improving living and working conditions for Scots, they have prioritized pushing for separation referendums and centralizing power by stripping authority from local councils. Their disregard for constitutional constraints—such as the reserved nature of constitutional matters—further underscores their monomaniacal pursuit. This pattern is not unique to Scotland; similar dynamics, though less pronounced, exist with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland and Plaid Cymru in Wales.</p>



<p>The reality is stark: devolved legislatures have not neutralized separatism but have instead enabled it. As long as Holyrood exists, the SNP—or any future separatist party—can regain power and resume their campaign for independence. Their strategy of "neverendum"—repeated referendums until they achieve their desired outcome—poses a perpetual threat to the UK. A fluke win or a war of attrition could eventually exhaust pro-UK resistance, leading to the breakup of the UK.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Short-Term Imperative: Tactical Voting</h3>



<p>Given the immediate risk of another referendum, short-term action is essential. The SNP’s current dominance in Holyrood must be challenged through a robust campaign of tactical voting. By uniting pro-UK voters to oust the SNP from power, the threat of an imminent referendum can be neutralized. This approach buys time but does not address the underlying structural vulnerability: the existence of Holyrood itself.</p>



<p>Voting out the SNP is a temporary fix. History shows that separatist parties can return to power and resume their agenda. As the saying goes, they only need to be lucky once, while pro-UK forces must win every time. A more permanent solution is needed to safeguard the UK.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Long-Term Solution: Abolish Devolved Legislatures</h3>



<p>The only way to eliminate the perpetual threat of separatism is to dismantle the mechanism that enables it: devolved legislatures. Holyrood, Stormont, and the Welsh Senedd have become tools for separatist movements to amplify their agendas. Abolishing these bodies would remove the institutional platform that allows parties like the SNP to dominate regional politics and pursue their anti-UK goals.</p>



<p>In their place, the UK should return to a system of common representation in a single, sovereign national parliament. The House of Commons, with its 650 seats allocated proportionally across Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, ensures that decisions reflect the collective will of the UK. Even if separatist parties like the SNP, Sinn Féin, or Plaid Cymru were to win every seat in their respective regions, they would remain a minority in Westminster, unable to force through their agenda against the majority of pro-UK MPs.</p>



<p>This system is fair, democratic, and proportionate. It ensures that the moderate majority prevails while keeping fringe movements in check. Without devolved legislatures, separatists would lack the institutional power to advance their cause, reducing their influence to a manageable level within the broader UK parliamentary framework.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Dual Strategy for a Secure UK</h3>



<p>Defeating anti-UK separatism requires a pragmatic, two-pronged approach—a pincer movement to protect the UK in both the short and long term. First, tactical voting must be employed to remove the SNP from power in Holyrood, preventing an immediate referendum. Second, the devolved legislatures must be abolished to eliminate the structural risk they pose, ensuring that separatist movements cannot regain a foothold to threaten the UK in the future.</p>



<p>The stakes are high. The UK’s survival depends on recognizing the failure of devolution to neutralize separatism and taking decisive action to address it. By combining immediate electoral strategies with a bold constitutional reform, the UK can permanently secure its unity against the relentless tide of separatism.</p>
