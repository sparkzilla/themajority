<p>On our daily trawl through the nether regions of Scottish twitter we came across <a href="https://twitter.com/AUOBALBA/status/1272931922587549700">this thread by @AOUBAlba</a>. As you may recall, All Under One Banner organise pro-Separation marches for 99.99% of the Scottish population who stay home.</p>



<p>I've been in chats with quite a few of these marchers who claim their Nationalism is "civic and joyous". Yet is that really true? Yesterday, AUOB asked the question, "What's the first thing that should be changed once Scotland regains independence?"</p>



<p>The responses to their question, show <strong>the intolerant, anti-English insanity that's at the Braveheart of Scottish Nationalism.</strong> Please share this widely so the world can see what we're dealing with...</p>







<h2>Get out of our one-party state</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/All-who-have-shown-allegiance-to-UK-should-be-banned.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6477"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Ban-unionist-parties.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6479"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/No-English-parties.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6480"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/No-Tories.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6496"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/English-based-parties.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6505"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Proportional-representation.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6510"/></figure>



<p>For many Nationalists their prime goal is simply to rid the country of people they don't agree with. If you're a Tory or a Red Tory or against them, they don't want you in "their" Scotland.  They genuinely want a one-party state that is ethnically and politically cleansed.</p>



<p><strong>These are widely-held Nationalist views. </strong></p>







<h2>Day of reckoning</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Truth-Commission.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6483"/></figure>



<p>We all remember Jim Sillars "<a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/day-reckoning-post-yes-vote-says-jim-sillars-1526501">Day of Reckoning</a>". In an independent Scottish state, we all know that <a href="https://themajority.scot/2020/06/13/five-times-scottish-nationalists-bullied-the-media/">Nationalist bullies</a> would have no qualms about targetiing those who were against them. </p>







<h2>It's oor oil!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Its-oor-oil.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6508"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Use-the-hidden-oil-fields.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6476"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/North-sea-oil-revenue.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6481"/></figure>



<p>With oil at $30 a barrel there's not going to be much infrastructure spending, lads.</p>







<h2>Keep a nuclear sub handy, y'know, just in case</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Indian-givers.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6493"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Keep-9-of-nukes.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6487"/></figure>



<p>Why do you need the nukes? To deal with people who drive on the left? Or could it be that you want to...</p>







<h2>Nuke the English!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Launch-nuclear-weapons-at-English.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6484"/></figure>



<p>No, not driven by anti-English bigotry at all. #Civicandjoyous.</p>







<h2>And then invade England</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Invade-England-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6506"/></figure>



<p>We must burn the village to save the village!</p>







<h2>Ban Marches</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Ban-Marches.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6499"/></figure>

<h2>Shift the border. That's easy, right?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/North-Sea-border.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6497"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Hadrians-Wall.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6503"/></figure>



<p>Not really sure how changing the border in the sea gets you more land.</p>







<h2>Burn Royal Castles</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Burn-the-castles.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6504"/></figure>



<p>Seems wasteful. But then again some men just want to see the world burn. </p>







<h2>Revenge by...bank note</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/English-Bank-Notes.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6470"/></figure>



<p>One has to wonder the path that takes someone from hearing about Scottish bank notes not being accepted to supporting separation from the UK. I wonder if some leaders have amped up that grievance?</p>



<p>And, anyway, I think you'll find, pal, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwBB1Izls1w">it's legal tender.</a></p>







<h2>Indy for everyone, whether they want it or not.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Indy-is-good-even-if-I-dont-live-there.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6485"/></figure>



<p>Aidan is confused. Don't be like Aidan.</p>







<h2>Show me the money!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Sovereign-wealth-fund.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6492"/></figure>



<p>And where is this money going to come from @graemeinlondon? London?</p>







<h2>Destroy the BBC</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Burn-the-BBC-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6486"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Scour-the-BBCs-files..png" alt="" class="wp-image-6500"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/BBC-staff-arrested.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6502"/></figure>



<p>Pitchforks at the ready! But what would you replace the BBC with?</p>







<h2>We need our own Scottish media</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Media-ownership.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6495"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Scottish-media.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6489"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/BBC-Scotland-closed-down.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6490"/></figure>



<p>Guys, we already have a Scottish channel that nobody watches. If the three of  you watched it you could triple the viewing figures. </p>







<h2>Flower of Scotland. Of course.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Flower-of-Scotland.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6501"/></figure>



<p>Sure, use an anti-English dirge as your anthem.</p>







<h2>Zoooooom!</h2>



<p>And finally, some of the nuttier suggestions. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Saltcoats.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6488"/></figure>



<p>Hmm. Just wondering if you need to gain indpendence to do that. Perhaps take it up with the council?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/Stirling.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6494"/></figure>



<p>Holyrood is too far from my house, so we should spend even more money moving it...</p>



<p>And finally...</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/images/posts/unicorn.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6555"/></figure>







<h2>Help us fight back</h2>



<p>In less than a year there's going to be a Scottish election, and there is no doubt that Nationalists like those in this article will use it to <strong>sow further division</strong> and continue to <strong>agitate for a disastrous referendum.</strong> </p>



<p>We need to build our resources now and <strong>get more of these articles out.</strong> If you like what you read here, please drop us a <strong>monthly donation</strong> so that we can fight back against their <strong>ugly Nationalism.</strong> </p>
